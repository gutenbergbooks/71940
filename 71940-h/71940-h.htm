<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>For some years past it had been my intention to write a progressive
series of treatises on the Australian aboriginal, embodying
observations as they were being made. As time wore
on, however, my procrastination amassed so great a fund and so
great a variety of notes that my original plan became impossible.
The delay was not altogether through any fault of mine, but
through a run of fortunate happenings which allowed me to
spend the better part of every year in the great unbounded
spaces of central and northern Australia, to live among the
uncontaminated tribes, and to study Australian anthropology at
the fountain head. It was through my repeated and prolonged
absences from the city (and civilization in general) that I could
not attend to the publication of any lengthy scientific papers.</p>

<p>Apart from my private and professional journeys, the following
are some of the better known expeditions I have accompanied
or led:</p>

</div>

<p>During the terms that I held official positions, firstly as a
State Geologist, and secondly as Chief Medical Officer and
Chief Protector of Aborigines for the Commonwealth Government
in the Northern Territory, opportunities were afforded
me of continuing my investigations among the indigenous population
of Australia; especially fruitful were my researches when,
as a Special Aborigines’ Commissioner, I medically overhauled
the tribes of South Australia and of the southern region of the
Northern Territory.</p>

<p>In a more private capacity the southern districts and goldfields
of Western Australia, the coastal and south-western districts
of Queensland, and the north-western areas of New South
Wales were traversed. Quite recently, too, a professional excursion
to Java considerably enriched my knowledge of Melanesian
ethnography and helped to explain the existence of several
cults in the northern districts of Australia which border on the
Indian Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, not long before the war I continued
study abroad and was privileged to be associated with the late
Professor Hermann Klaatsch, under whose admirable guidance
my researches were conducted in the Anatomical School of the
University of Breslau. It will be apparent, therefore, why
many of the results enumerated in the chapters dealing with
the racial characteristics of the Australian aboriginal are based
upon the doctrines of this eminent authority. In London Sir
Arthur Keith courteously placed the whole of the valuable
collections of Australian skulls and skeletons in the Hunterian
Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons at my disposal;
while Captain T. A. Joyce, in an equally generous way, facilitated
my investigations in the anthropological galleries of the
British Museum; I am taking advantage of this opportunity of
expressing my sincere gratitude to these two gentlemen. I also
desire to thank the Directors of the National and University
Museums which I visited in France, Germany, Switzerland,
and Holland, who so willingly responded to my enquiries and
brought me into personal contact with any matters I was
especially interested in.</p>

<p>While engaged upon one of my later commissions in central
Australia, my duties took me to the Hermannsburg Mission
Station on the Finke River, where for a fortnight I enjoyed the
companionship of the Rev. Carl Strehlow and received every
assistance in my researches among the western groups of the
Arunndta tribe. Through the recent pathetic and heroic death
of Strehlow, Science has lost an indefatigable and conscientious
worker, and the aborigines a staunch and faithful friend.</p>

<p>In the present volume I have endeavoured to sift my subject
matter in such a way as to keep the text in a suitable sequence
and to make it of general interest. The principal difficulty has
been to delete matter in order to keep down the bulk of the
book. The latter remark applies equally well to the selection
of illustrations; it was with a heavy heart that I found myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
obliged to reduce the number of plates, all of which illustrated
interesting points referred to in the text. Nevertheless, I feel
that I am greatly indebted to the publisher, Mr. F. W. Preece,
for allowing me to include so many more illustrations than he
had originally counted upon.</p>

<p>Now that the manuscript is in the hands of the printer, I
feel that there are several chapters I should like to have done
more justice to; those, for instance, dealing with tribal organizations,
initiation ceremonies, religious ideas, and art might
have been considerably expanded if it had not been for the
want of space. In those on religious ideas and art, I realize
that I am launching in new directions so far as Australian
anthropology is concerned, but I trust that the evidence which
I have produced will be sufficient to prove that I did not arrive
at the results too hastily, or, indeed, without deliberation and
substantiation. Phallic worship had long been suspected in
Australia, and some of our foremost authorities, such as the late
R. Etheridge, Jun., were inclined to explain the occurrence of
certain stones and other objects in the tribal areas of Australia
(present or past) on that hypothesis. I came upon the evidence
accidentally in 1916 in the form of a stone phallus erected in
the ground at Success Strait in the far north-western corner of
Australia. The stone was surrounded by a cleared cirque
where much blood had been spilt at a recent ceremony. A few
weeks later I for the first time witnessed an actual performance
on the shores of Cambridge Gulf at which wooden phallus
were produced. Since then I have been able to trace the
existence of phallic worship of some form or other in several
districts of central and northern Australia, an outline of which
appears in a subsequent chapter. I trust that the facts I have
been able to collect may help to illumine the somewhat doubtful
question of how an aboriginal looks upon the process of procreation.
Phallicism is closely related to such forms of Nature
worship as are practised in order to make any species of animal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
or plant proliferate, or, for that matter, to bring down a shower
of rain in times of drought. The phallus might gradually
merge into a tjuringa. The painted “<i>Ngadanji</i>” and “<i>Ilbarinam</i>”
tjuringas of the Arunndta tribe are regarded as images
of the reproductive organ of a spirit which can generate life;
in that sense they might be classed as phallus. I find that
ancestor worship is generally indulged in; it is difficult at times
to distinguish between an original spirit ancestor and a deity,
but a Supreme Spirit or Deity is believed to exist and to rule
over all creation.</p>

<p>With regard to totemism, I have shown the beliefs in a
manner slightly different from those hitherto recorded. The
mystical relationship between individual and object is traced to
a mythical semi-human forerunner which was common to both
and is now a spirit. The Arunndta call the spirit “<i>Knaninja</i>.”
The animal or plant relative of an individual is what has been
commonly called the “totem” in Australian ethnology, while
the symbolic representation of this object, which becomes the
crest of the individual, corresponds to the “<i>kobong</i>” first described
by Sir George Grey. Emblematic representations of
both the “totemic” object and of the Knaninja are embodied in
the tjuringa of the individual.</p>

<p>The essay on art, it will be observed, has been written on
evolutional lines with respect to both technique and design. It
will be understood that the material upon which the conclusions
are based was collected in many parts of Australia and
during many years of travel. The cults in question are in many
cases distributed all over the continent, but occasionally are
quite local. As an instance of the latter kind, I mention the
famous drawings recorded by Sir George Grey, some of which
I was fortunate in being able to locate and study on the Glenelg
River in the far north-west. I might mention that, with very
few exceptions, the designs appearing in the book as text figures
are actual tracings reduced by photography to a size in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
with the dimensions of the page. There is no doubt that primitive
art in Australia is a fascinating study which has not received
the attention it merits; and unfortunately it is rather
late in the day to think of making a start. The system of
conventionalism derived from the numerous pictographs and
carvings is the basis of all characters and messages one finds on
sticks, stones, and persons; it is the only key to an understanding
of sacred tjuringa symbols. We have for too long
looked upon aboriginal designs as meaningless, and upon aboriginal
art production as being idle concoctions out of nothing
which were invented just to make a thing “look pretty.” This
is anything but the true position. An aboriginal artist knows
no such thing as a design without motive or origin; to him the
shortest line or the smallest circle conveys a thought. In the
chapter dealing with stone implements, I have, among other
things, described a new type of scraper which was used by the
now extinct Adelaide tribe for trimming skins of animals.</p>

<p>The article on language is not intended to be at all comprehensive;
my main object was to give a general idea of the construction,
together with a few examples of the idiomatic uses,
of the aboriginal tongue. I hope at a later date to be able to
present a complete account of the Arunndta and Aluridja dialects,
including the syntactical rules and grammatical forms.</p>

<p>I have to offer an apology to any authors who may claim
priority to some of the facts which I mention in this book. I
have written this account of the Australian aboriginal without
attempting to consult previous literature, for the simple reason
that, had I started looking up all necessary references, the
volume might never have been completed. My time at headquarters
has been so limited during the last fifteen years that,
in the absence of a library near at hand, it was impossible for
me to adopt any other method than to write up my observations
at first-hand and run the risk of a certain amount of trespass.
Nevertheless, I trust that the authors so affected will realize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
that there was no slight intended and will treat my transgression
in the spirit of independent corroboration.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of Australian ethnology is so meagre that
every man who has had first-hand experience among the tribes
should consider it his bounden duty to place on record any facts
he possesses, however trivial they may be. Every year the
number of people who have seen the unsophisticated savage is
dwindling. When I look back to the time of my first meeting
with the tribes of central Australia, just twenty years ago, and
compare the conditions of then and now, I shudder to think
how quickly the romance of aboriginal affairs, together with all
the scientific treasures it encompassed, has vanished, and is now
irretrievably lost to the world. The rising generation will not
have the advantage of men of even our time. Bones, stone
artefacts, and wooden implements will remain in our museums
for ever, but the habits, laws, beliefs, and legends are doomed
to rapid extinction.</p>

<p>I do not claim to be an initiated member of any tribe. To
be candid, I several times tried to qualify by impressive exhibitions
of surgical skill and exaggerated munificence, but, although
I gained the confidence and goodwill of the old men,
I was informed that I could only be accepted provided I passed
through the different grades of initiation and submitted to the
attendant mutilations in the orthodox way. The medicine men,
however, usually claimed me as a “<i>Kata</i>” or colleague, and
allowed me to witness most of their rituals and sacred ceremonies,
which they carefully explained to me. In this way I
was able, also, to secure a very great series of photographs depicting
intimate scenes from aboriginal life, many of which are
unique. The only photographs illustrating this book which
were not taken by me are those reproduced in Plates <a href="#plate48">XLVIII</a>
and <a href="#plate49">XLIX</a>; for these I am indebted to the late Mr. Nicholas
Holtze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span></p>

<p>I could not allow this opportunity to pass without making
brief reference to the causes of the early extinction which is
threatening these inoffensive, useful, and scientifically important
people. We have only to cast our eyes in the direction of any
wave of settlement to behold the disastrous effects our occupation
of the land has had on the natives. Take, for instance, the
Lake Eyre region, which embraces the Dieri, Yantowannta,
Ngameni, and Yauroworka tribes. Official reports show that
only forty years ago the population was so dense that the white
settlers asked for greater police protection; the four tribes mentioned
numbered many thousands. During a recent survey on
behalf of the Government, I could barely muster three hundred
wretched and decrepit souls in this region, who, literally
speaking, were waiting for a lingering death to relieve them of
their misery. We content ourselves by saying that civilization
is the cause of the increased mortality, no doubt a plausible but
very vague explanation. As a result of my investigations, I
venture the opinion that the factor which has wrought the
greatest havoc among the tribes is disease. The principal
scourges are syphilis, pulmonary tuberculosis, and trachoma.
Unless we realize the obligations which rest on our shoulders
and give our natives a medical protection similar to the successful
measures adopted by the United States, Canada, and
New Zealand, they will continue to vanish and soon be classed
as an extinct race.</p>

<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION TO AN AUSTRALIAN TRIBE</span></h2>

<p>The lonely bush of Australia—The silence is broken—A mysterious
call-note—A human figure in the distance—Coo-ee!—A voluntary
but cautious escort—The official approach and salutation—Friendship
established—Tribal introductions.</p>

</div>

<p>Let us imagine that we are travelling with a caravan over a
lonely tract of ground, in a remote district of the Australian
bush, which has not been contaminated by any disturbing
influence of our civilization. In consequence of the serenity
and the deserted aspect of the scene around us, we would be
wondering whether the place holds any mortal creatures but
our party. We might even have resigned ourselves to the inevitable
desolation.</p>

<p>Suddenly the spell is broken by a faint sound falling upon
our ears—a long-drawn, shrill, yet melodious note—then all is
silent again.</p>

<p>What could it have been? We are in doubt as to whether
this was the call of a bird or animal, or a phenomenon unknown
to us; being so far away from any centre of industry, a locomotive
or factory whistle is quite out of the question. Eagerly
we wait for a possible repetition of the singular sound.</p>

<p>Soon, indeed, it comes again; and, with the attentiveness our
expectation has solicited, we now recognize the human character
of the note. Presently it is repeated, then again, and yet again.
But where does it come from? So far we know not.</p>

<p>In the meantime we continue forging through the sand, and,
being now on the alert, we in due course espy, in the direction
whence the sound is coming, but a considerable distance off, a
slim, dark figure gliding from the cover of a rock to that of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
bush. Presently it again shows itself a short distance on; and
our attention is further attracted by the appearance of one or
two other dark bodies running from cover to cover in a line
parallel to our course.</p>

<p>The calling is continued at frequent intervals; and, as near
as we can represent it by our alphabet, it sounds like the word
“Coy!” with the “y” specially emphasized and spun out. One
has no difficulty in recognizing in this call-note, which is met
with all over Australia, the derivation of the familiar “Coo-ee!”</p>

<p>It is, of course, assumed that we in no way betray a feeling
of uneasiness or give these dusky fellows the impression that we
are preparing for hostilities. Having satisfied themselves in
respect of this, and after manoeuvring for a considerable time in
the manner described, our uninvited escort become more trusting,
even daring. They run or walk for longer distances away from
cover and gradually bring their line of travelling closer in to
ours. When eventually they realize that we seem more like
friend than foe, they drop behind our caravan, and, at a
measured distance, in our trail. Whenever we move, they
move, and when we stop, they stop. If any of our party go
towards them, they turn to the side and cleverly disappear into
the bush (<a href="#plate01">Plate I</a>).</p>

<p>When we have arrived at the end of our day’s journey and
camp, they pull up short and squat for a while; although it may
not appear so to the inexperienced traveller, they are taking
stock of all our doings.</p>

<p>Before very long, two men stand up and beckon to a small
boy among their party, who immediately jumps to his feet and
walks to a place in front of his elders. Each of the men now
holds one of his hands upon the lad’s shoulder, and, in that
position, the little group moves towards our camp.</p>

<p>In the hands not so used, both men are now seen to be
carrying small branches of <i>Cassia</i> bush, which they occasionally
lift towards us. Thus they walk to within fifty or sixty paces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of our encampment and again squat on the ground, arranging
themselves in the same order as they walked in. It is apparent
they want us to approach them; and we do so.</p>

<p>Statuary could not be more rigid than the persons we behold,
upon arriving at the little group. They sit silently, with downcast
eyes, and it is not until we address them that they rise to
their feet. The old men, for such we now recognize them to
be, start a meek conversation, nervously pushing the boy towards
us. We are informed that this is an uninitiated boy, a child
in fact, a piccaninny in the tribal relationship of son to the
speakers. We are implored not to hurt this innocent being,
and to extend that friendship to themselves and to all the
members of the tribe. It is pointed out that they are unarmed
and that this is the guarantee of their goodly intentions towards
us, the unknown wanderers.</p>

<p>The men now advance and pat us on the chest, and instinctively
we return the compliment—for such it is intended
to be—which is akin to any ordinary European method of
salutation. The bonds of friendship have thus been sealed, and
the men continue to jabber profusely on the more intricate
tribal relationships existing between themselves and the rest of
their party.</p>

<p>When the genealogical explanations have been concluded, the
men turn towards their company, who are still squatting in the
distance, and call aloud to them to come along: “<i>Pitchai, ngalla
pitchai, waipella tami pu!</i>” which in the Wongapitcha dialect
stands for “Come along, the white fellow is good.” The invitation
is quickly responded to, and ere many minutes have
passed the whole group has arrived, which includes other men
as well as women and children. The new arrivals, without
hesitation, and with seeming confidence, join in the conversation.</p>

<p>So this is our introduction to the aboriginal, the primitive
hunting man of Australia, and his family!</p>

</div>

<p>Let us study these interesting-looking people more closely and
endeavour to find out their characteristic features, and in what
respects they differ from ourselves. At the same time, let us
in passing ascertain to what degree they resemble us and other
peoples, past or present, and what peculiarities they might share
with the man-apes or lower forms of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>What immediately appeals to our critical eye is the strong
contrast in the general outline of the figure when we compare
it with our own. The round, full contours and shapely exterior
of the European are replaced by an angularity and straightness
in the aboriginal. The surface-padding or, more correctly, the
subcutaneous deposition of fatty tissue, which makes the lines
and curves of our bodies so uniform—and the female figure so
beautiful—is, to a large extent, the result of long selective
culture and of the comforts which civilized life has brought
with it. In the case of the aboriginal, however, the forethought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
of Nature has not allowed the development of such paddings of
fat to any considerable amount; they would only tend to impede
the agility of the hardy desert roamer. He does not need a
thick layer of fat beneath his skin. From an artistic point of
view, the leanness of his body is quite becoming to himself. He
lives in a country whose climate is hot, and his healthy hunting-life
makes him immune from many of the ills to which the city
dweller is heir. As a reserve storage of heat and nourishment,
therefore, which might be called upon to aid his physiological
constitution in times of need, the quantity of superfluous fat
can safely be reduced to a minimum. Nature has given enough,
but not a measure in excess. Thus, without any indication of
unhealthy emaciation, the integumentary accumulation of fat is
so scant that parts of the internal anatomy of an aboriginal can
readily be deciphered topographically. We can follow the shape
of the superficial muscles and of the skeleton, and can palpate
the outline of the abdominal organs with comparative ease.
Although the muscles are small, they are, nevertheless, strong,
firm, and wiry; this is particularly noticeable in the extremities.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact, however, that there is a natural predisposition
in the aboriginal to produce fatty tissue once he gives
up his active hunting career, like a sportsman out of training,
and to develop a perceptible obesity when he lives under conditions
which supply him daily with an abundance of nourishment.
Under such circumstances, which are of course abnormal
and only brought about by European influence, his skin is very
apt to accumulate locally masses of fat known medically as
<i>lipomas</i>. The Arunndta natives call these tumours “<i>lurra</i>,”
and connect their appearance upon their bodies with heavy
weight-carrying. It is, indeed, a noteworthy fact that these
fatty tumours frequently occur upon the shoulders of aboriginal
wood-carriers, who are in the habit of collecting logs of timber
for camp or station purposes.</p>

<p>Associated with the angularity and flatness of the bodily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
form, we notice, when looking upon the figure of an aboriginal
in profile, and comparing it with that of an European in a
similar position, a straightness of the spine. If, for instance,
we were to make an accurate drawing of the spinal curvatures
of the two subjects shown in <a href="#plate02">Plate II</a>, we would find that the
line representing the spinal column of the aboriginal gin would
be very straight in the centre of the back, that is, in the dorsal
segment; in fact it would be found that the dorsal curve is
very slight. Careful comparisons have been made with frozen
corpses of different races and the man-apes, bisected in the
mesial plane, and it has been determined that this portion of
the spine is flatter in the Australian aboriginal than in any
other race of man; and indeed it is flatter than in the chimpanzee.
Moreover, a larger number of vertebræ are involved
in the dorsal curve of the Australian than there are in the
other cases.</p>

<p>In the European subject of our illustration—a young Australian
lady—the lumbo-sacral curve, known usually as the
<i>ensellure</i>, is unusually prominent.</p>

<p>If now we examine the curvature of that portion of the
backbone which constitutes the neck, we shall find it less pronounced
in the European but strongly developed in the Australian
aboriginal.</p>

<p>But perhaps the greatest difference between the two types is
the manner in which the curvature breaks from the lumbar to
the sacral portions of the spine. In the European this break is
sharp and angular; in the Australian it is very gradual on
account of a peculiar oblique position of the last lumbar vertebra.
Should we, again, extend our observation to the chimpanzee,
we would find that a number of the sacral vertebræ are included
in the lumbar curve. Consequently the aboriginal’s spine seems
to occupy an interesting position in which the last lumbar
vertebra stands almost as a connecting link between the lumbar
curve above and the sacral curve immediately below it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>The lumbar curve is greater in the European than in the
Australian, but it is decidedly greater in the chimpanzee. The
difference in curvature is brought about mainly by the discs of
cartilage which exist between the vertebræ, and that is why
there is a considerable movement possible in the lumbar portion
of the spine of the lower races of man; and it is quite possible
that the lumbar curvature alters according to the position
adopted by the individual, that is, according to whether he be
in a standing or in his favourite squatting posture. In the
European the corresponding portion of the spine is much more
rigid.</p>

<p>The proportional lengths of cervical, dorsal, and lumbar
spinal sections are much the same in both European and Australian,
but there are considerable differences in the two spines
so far as the proportions of the bony vertebræ and the intervertebral
discs of cartilage are concerned, especially in the
lumbar region. The lumbar vertebræ of the European are
shorter than are those of the Australian, and the latter again
are shorter than those of the man-apes. In other words, the
lengths of the bones, which build up the lumbar portion of the
spinal column, increase (<i>i.e.</i> in proportion to the size of the
column as a whole) as one passes from the most highly cultured
European through the primitive human stages, like the aboriginal
of Australia, to the anthropoid apes, and finally to the lower
types of monkeys. At the same time, as the length of the
vertebræ increases, a reduction in the thickness of the cartilaginous
discs takes place.</p>

<p>There is no doubt this phenomenon depends to some extent
upon the acquisition of the upright attitude by man, since the
cartilage between the bone acts as an effective shock-absorber—the
percussion produced by the impact of the heel against the
ground when walking being reduced before it reaches the brain.
When the brain-box does not rest immediately above the point<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
of percussion, as for instance in the semi-erect posture of the
apes, the dangers of concussion are not so great.</p>

<p>While we are discussing the vertebral column of the Australian
aboriginal, we might draw attention to the comparative
smallness of the bones composing it. If we were, for instance,
to compare the column of an Australian with that of a
European of similar height, we would find that the vertebræ
of the former are appreciably the smaller—their volumes being
almost in the ratio of one to one-and-a-half. This is the more
striking since we shall learn later that the Australian aboriginal
often is quite as tall in stature as the European. The skeleton
of the African negro, on the other hand, is decidedly more
massive than that of the European.</p>

<p>The smallness of the bones composing the vertebral column
undoubtedly favours the flexibility and agility which characterize
the Australians as a hunting people. There are, it is true,
certain variations in the structure of the spinal column of the
Australian, which seem to contradict this general rule, as, for
instance, a slightly stronger development of the vertebræ of the
neck and a greater volume of the lumbar vertebral bones in
the female. The former of these features is no doubt a primitive
characteristic throwing back to the quadrupedal ancestry of
the human species, the latter having to do with the processes
of birth.</p>

<p>The sacral bone at the lower end of the vertebral column
varies slightly in size, but is, generally speaking, much narrower
than that of the European or of any other living race. It is
principally on this account that the hip-bones of the Australians
seem remarkably close together in both sexes.</p>

<p>The fifth lumbar vertebra of the Australian often exhibits
certain sacral characters, which remind one of the orang outang;
in that anthropoid the fifth lumbar bone is often fused to the
<i>os sacrum</i> and in reality becomes the first sacral body. Occasionally
this vertebra is asymmetrical, being normal, <i>i.e.</i> lumbar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
on the one side and sacral on the other. Its posterior
arch is at times wanting, the spines having failed to join, as
ordinarily they do, in a median line behind the main body of
the bone. The last named feature is, however, not infrequently
observed in the skeletons of other races as well.</p>

<p>Another very striking feature, connected with the anatomy
of the Australian, is the great length of his arms and legs.
This length of extremities is taken in a conjoint sense, and
with regard to the height of the individual. The aboriginal is
often said to have very much longer arms than legs. This is
incorrect. In point of fact, no human type is known, living or
fossil, with such a disproportion in the limbs. All types of
mankind, individually considered, have arms and legs more or
less equal in length; from this original condition the elongated
arms, so typical of apes, have evolved, by secondary processes, in
all probability through the acquisition of arboreal habits. There
is, of course, no doubt that the length of the extremities, both
upper and lower, so characteristic of the Australian, together
with the relative slenderness of the vertebræ, points to an early
evolutional stage, which was common to the ancestral forms of
both man and ape. The monkey has brought tree-climbing
to such a degree of perfection that it practically lives in the
branches. Primitive man, too, has not neglected the art, and,
although the normal proportions of his extremities do not
directly suggest tree-climbing, there is another development
which does, especially in the Australian; and that is his foot.</p>

<p>When we consider the likely transformations which the
human foot has undergone from an original hand-like form,
resembling that of certain monkeys and lower primates, to its
present condition, we shall find that two processes have been at
work in the modelling of this important part of man’s anatomy.
Firstly, the big toe (originally a thumb) has taken up a position
adjacent to that of the next digit (originally an index finger),
and, by lying in the same plane with it, has forfeited its power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
of opposition. Secondly, the big toe has grown appreciably
stronger, while the other digits have become smaller and weaker.
That the big toe, in its ancient evolution, once stood in the
same relation to the other toes as the thumb does to the fingers
of the hand, is evident from the arrangement of the blood-vessels
and nerves in this part of the foot, corresponding exactly
to that of the hand, even though the gap originally existing
between the first and second digits has been filled by fleshy tissue.</p>

<p>It is of considerable scientific interest to note that cases are
occasionally observed among the Australian tribes in which
indications of this ancestral condition are retained. In the
<a href="#figure02">Fig. 2</a> we see the feet of an aboriginal of the Berringin tribe
in the north of Australia, whose big toes are remarkable for
their shortness when compared with the second.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="figure02" style="max-width: 25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 2. Peculiar “hand-like” feet of the Berringin tribesmen. Tracing from
a photograph.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is, of course, a well-known fact that the newly-born
European baby possesses a wonderful mobility in its feet; and
such might also be acquired by people who have lost their arms;
but the wearing of boots usually deprives modern nations of
this freedom of movement. The aborigines of Australia make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
frequent use of their toes. A considerable lateral flexibility of
the end phalanges enables them to lift small objects off the
ground between the big and second toes. Spears are carried by
warriors, between the toes of either foot, to conceal the weapons
in the grass; and so the enemy is led to believe that the men are
unarmed.</p>

<p>When collecting firewood, the gins never stoop to pick up
the pieces, but lift them with their toes to the level of their
hands. The hands then pile the fuel upon the head and hold
it there until sufficient has been collected to carry back to camp.</p>

<p>The power of being able to use the toes in the manner
described depends upon the development of a muscle, which
arising from the outer side of the fibula and terminating in a
long tendon, passes obliquely across the sole of the foot, to
insert itself into the metatarsal bone of the great toe. This
is the long <i>peroneus</i> muscle, the function of which, in the
monkeys at any rate, is to keep the big toe in opposition. In
man, moreover, this muscle helps considerably to maintain
the arch of the foot. Flatfoot is eminently rare among the
aborigines; only one or two cases have come under observation.</p>

<p>When walking, the aboriginal carries his foot so that it
points directly ahead of him, and not, as has been written,
“with his toes well turned out.” If anything, the sole of the
foot is slightly tilted so that the outer border touches the ground
a little in advance of the ball.</p>

<p>There is no doubt the outer surface and the ball of the foot
play an important role in the art of tree-climbing, as it is
practised by the Australians and other primitive peoples. Several
methods are in vogue; they will be described later. Suffice it,
for the time being, to refer to one: In pursuit of small marsupials,
young birds, honey, nuts, fruits, or any other things
good to eat, the aboriginal often has occasion to ascend the tall
smooth trunks of trees, which harbour such articles in abundance.
This is done, often without the aid of any implement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
in the following way: The hunter faces the tree and applies
the palms of his hands to the opposite side of the butt. As he
tightens his hold with his fingers, he springs from the ground
and clutches the butt between the soles of his feet. The arches
adjust themselves to the convexity of the trunk, whilst the
pressure of the outer edges and balls of the feet prevent the
limbs from slipping. In this posture, the hunter is virtually
hanging by his arms, which are hooked by the hands, and is
sitting upon his heels, which are fixed firmly against the tree,
as described. Holding his head well back between the shoulder-blades,
he suddenly lifts his body upwards with his thighs,
while his hands, momentarily relaxing their hold, are pushed
upwards also. Now the fingers again tightly clasp the trunk,
and the feet are quickly lifted and tucked under the buttocks,
to again support the weight of the body as before. The same
actions are repeated, time after time, and it is not long before
the climber reaches the nearest branches, when progress is
simplified. Vide <a href="#plate19">Plate XIX</a>, 2.</p>

<p>Comparison of European with Aboriginal figure.</p>

<p>“We notice, when looking upon the figure of an aboriginal in profile, and
comparing it with that of an European in a similar position, a straightness
of the spine.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This ancient custom of tree-climbing is not peculiar to the
Australians, but is adopted by most primitive races. It is very
probable, too, that the prehistoric races were to a large extent
arboreal, and made use of similar methods of tree-climbing.
When considering the evolution of the human foot, therefore,
we will have to remember that it has been to some extent
influenced by the tree-climbing factor, which, indeed, must be
considered in the light of a forerunning stage in the acquisition
of the upright attitude by man.</p>

<p>In this primitive method of ascending trees, by which the
head is thrown so far behind, we see also a likely explanation
of the greater cervical curvature we have noticed in the
aboriginal’s spine, when one compares it with the European’s.
We might even venture to say that these processes originally
brought about the lumbar curvature, and thereby laid the foundation
to the acquisition of the erect posture, by means of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
man learned to balance his head upon the vertical spinal column.
Then the foot, which had been to a great extent modelled
through his arboreal activities, stood man in good stead, and
he began to walk erect between the trees.</p>

<p>The foot skeleton of the Tasmanian shows a peculiarity, in
which it differs from that of the Australian on the mainland.
Under normal conditions, the heel-bone of the Australian, and
of the European as well, has a small elongation or process on the
anterior side which separates the two adjoining small bones, the
<i>cuboid</i> and the <i>talus</i>, from each other. But in the case of the
Tasmanian the two small bones named lie in juxtaposition. This
phenomenon is only occasionally noticed in Australian skeletons,
and is quite exceptional in European; it is abnormal even in
the anthropoids.</p>

<p>The Australian’s legs are often the subject of comment, if
not ridicule; they are so thin and lanky. Even when the
proportions of the chest and trunk as a whole are good, the
legs usually remain unshapely. Even under the best of conditions,
there is a paucity of flesh both in thigh and calf; the
lower portions of the limbs are in the true sense of the word
spindle-shanks.</p>

<p>Even the gluteal musculature is only moderately developed.
Sedentary life and cosmetic culture seem to have been the
principal factors at work in shaping this region in the modern
European. Monkeys, on the other hand, show no considerable
gluteal development at all. It would appear, therefore, that
tree-climbing has not played a great role in developing these
muscles, but seems rather to have influenced the growth of the
deltoid muscle, which extends from the upper arm to the
shoulder-blade and collar-bone, and of the big pectoral muscle.</p>

<p>The thigh-bone, although it is slender, like the rest of the
long bones of the Australian, is abruptly dilated at its epiphyses,
and, in that respect, differs considerably from the
European femur, which widens gradually towards the extremities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
in trumpet fashion. The Australian’s thigh-bone is more
like the Neanderthal type, but the smallness of its head at once
distinguishes it from the fossil. The slenderness of the shaft,
together with the relative smallness of the condyles, brings the
Australian femur nearer to the <i>Pithecanthropus</i>. Generally
speaking, this bone is stronger in the Tasmanian than in the
Australian.</p>

<p>One occasionally finds a strongly developed ridge or process
in the upper portion of the Australian femur, which has been
styled the third trochanter. At the lower extremity, the
smooth depression on the anterior surface of the bone, between
its condyles, is deep in the Australian and Tasmanian, and in
that respect resembles the Neanderthal femur. The superior
margin of the hyaline cartilage covering this depression is
variable, and occasionally far exceeds the average European
limit.</p>

<p>Among certain tribes of central and southern Australia, the
tibia is often peculiarly flattened laterally, like a sword, whilst
the anterior edge of the bone is remarkably prominent. This
condition is known as <i>platycnemia</i> and has also been observed,
quite frequently, in the skeletons of the extinct men of Europe
and Egypt, and in the Negroid and Polynesian races.</p>

<p>Occasionally this platycnemic condition is associated with
an exaggerated curvature of the anterior edge of the bone,
a phenomenon which Dr. E. C. Stirling has described as
<i>camptocnemia</i>. The popular name for it among bushmen is
“Boomerang-Leg”; in some cases the tibia certainly has quite
as large a curvature as some of the least bent of the familiar
throwing sticks have.</p>

<p>In attempting to offer an explanation for this remarkable
phenomenon, it is at the outset difficult to say to what extent
it might be pathological, that is, the direct result of some constitutional
disorder, like rickets, from which the individual, in
whose shin-bone the curvature appears, might be suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>A theory has, however, been advanced to the effect that, since
the anterior ridge of the bone represents part of the surface
from which the <i>tibialis posticus</i> muscle arises, and since this
muscle effects the adduction of the foot, when a person is
walking, it is feasible that the altered shape and the increased
bulk of the tibia may be due to that factor. The Australians,
like other primitive hunters, are possessed of an astounding
endurance when running down wounded game.</p>

<p>Dr. Ramsay Smith points out that there may be a connection
between a platycnemic condition and the peculiar method the
Australians have of lifting things from the ground with their
toes, by which the tibialis posticus muscle is specially involved.</p>

<p>The fibula of the Australian is straight, and, especially in the
case of the female Tasmanian, often has the end adjacent to
the knee, which is known as its head or capitulum, prolongated
in an extraordinary manner. This feature is of morphological
interest because it harks back to a primitive condition in the
evolution of the knee, in which the long bone of the lower
extremity played a more important part in the action of the
joint than it nowadays does in the human species.</p>

<p>In male Tasmanians the shoulder-blade is of considerable
length, and its apparent narrowness is primarily due to the
elongation of the infra-spinous fossa.</p>

<p>The humerus of the Australian shows a very small torsion,
the angle being less than in any other human type. A foramen
is not infrequently observed between the condyles of this bone.
The Tasmanian humerus possesses a peculiar, laterally convex
curve; and its internal condyle is often much enlarged.</p>

</figure>

<p>As with ourselves, the bodily height of the Australian varies
considerably, even within one and the same tribe. No great
racial importance can on that account be placed upon statistical
data in respect of height. The tallest individual I know of
was a man of Yarrabah, near Cairns, in Queensland, who stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
seven feet four inches high.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Some of the smallest men I have
ever seen lived in the Tomkinson Ranges in Central Australia,
who barely measured four feet six inches in height; yet among
the same tribe were many men who stood over six feet. The
smallest gin, the mother of two children, who has come under
my observation, measured four feet five-and-a-half inches. She
lived in the Katherine River district. We might claim from
five feet four-and-a-half inches to five feet six inches as a
reasonable average height for the male, and about five feet for
the female.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BREAST AND ABDOMEN</span></h2>

<p>The female breast—Aboriginal ideas of shapeliness—Traditional cultivation
by ceremonial—Prevalent shapes—Artificially induced
lactation—The abdominal region—“Pot-belly”—The sign of surfeiting
as well as of malnutrition—Living skeletons—Starvation a
justifiable cause of cannibalism.</p>

</div>

<p>The female breast varies much in size and consistency, according
to the age and physical (and physiological) condition
of the individual. As in most matters that concern the
aboriginal, his utilitarian inclination outweighs his æsthetic
instincts, even to the extent that he regards the breast of his
gin simply as that part of her “flesh,” which at the required
period contains or produces the nutrient “water,” necessary for
the rearing of his progeny. No breast, no matter how firm and
classically hemispherical it might be in our estimation, would
appeal to the aboriginal on account of its shapeliness. To him
the voluminous, pendant, udder-like form, which can comfortably
be handed over the gin’s shoulder, or under her arm, to
the babe riding upon her back, would seem the orthodox and
perfect creation. Indeed, among most of the tribes the husbands
endeavour to attain that type both by magical incantation
and by actual manipulation.</p>

<p>When the hour arrives that signs of adolescence first manifest
themselves in a girl, her future husband, to whom she has
long been assigned (perhaps even entirely speculatively, on the
chance of the sex, before ever she was born), sets about to conjure
up her feminine qualities. He may be, and usually is,
joined by other men, to whom tribal law has by descent given
claim to periodic domestic privileges approaching those of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
marital relationships which are to exist between the individual
husband and his gin.</p>

<p>Without advertisement, the tender novice is quietly coaxed
away from camp by the men, who, by talking kindly to her,
have no need to apply coercion. At no great distance they halt,
and the future husband anoints the areas surrounding both
nipples, which are likely to bulge forth as the future breasts,
with grease; the anointed areas are then covered with a layer
of red ochre. Whilst this is taking place, all present sing to
the budding milk-gland, first softly, then vehemently, and with
ceremony. During the performance on the North Coast, the
female dugong, whose motherly devotion to her young is a
recognised virtue, is frequently alluded to.</p>

<p>The painted areolas are frequently charmed by touching them
with a magic stone, and at intervals the enchanters bring an
anointed circle into contact with their lips, as if endeavouring
to draw the nipple forwards, that it might grow.</p>

<p>Ultimately the girl is told to return to the women, who take
her on a food-collecting expedition; during her absence from
camp, it is quite possible that the signs of approaching maturity
may become more definite.</p>

<p>The aboriginal breast begins to grow at an earlier age than
the European, on an average at about the tenth year. Neglecting
for the present the different phases in its development,
from the puerile papilla through various shapes, depending upon
the growth of the milk-gland and the deposition of fat about it,
one type of breast is typical of early adult life, that is the pear-shaped
form. In this type, especially in its earliest stages, the
secondary bulge beneath the nipple often fuses imperceptibly
with the basal hemisphere, so that a conoid shape results. In
older women, the breasts at times assume extraordinarily large
dimensions, especially when the individual is inclined to be on
the well-nourished side. In very old gins, who have born and
reared a number of children, the shape disappears entirely, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
breasts becoming mere flaps of skin. A full dry breast is the
exception rather than the rule; only in youthful cases, who have
not become mothers, do we meet with firm and standing breasts.
In later life, the inevitable sagging and attenuation are materially
increased by a child in arms which, as the mother plies and
looks for food, secures itself by firmly clasping one or both of
its parent’s breasts.</p>

<p>The breast is situated a little more laterally in the aboriginal
than in the European; and in the former case it is also lower
and more nearly mid-way between shoulder level and umbilicus.
One often finds the breasts of one and the same individual
unsymmetrically developed (<a href="#plate04">Plate IV</a>, 1).</p>

<p>In connection with the female breast, I have a somewhat
remarkable case of artificially induced lactation to record from
the Alligator Rivers district. The mother of an infant of
tender years having died, a younger sister of the deceased, who
had no children, volunteered to adopt the helpless mite. The
foster-mother diligently treated her breasts with a pulp she
made by mashing <i>Eugenia</i> leaves with ashes and sufficient water
to make a paste; and heated stones were placed over the breasts
at frequent intervals. The mammary glands and their surrounding
tissues were at every opportunity plied with the
fingers, and the babe’s lips were as often put to the nipples.
Within a short time, fluid formed in the breasts; and the child
was suckled. The fluid was said to have been more watery
than milk, but, nevertheless, made good nourishment for the
child. This case is by no means unique. A number of records
are available from different parts of the world, the most classical
among which is perhaps that mentioned by Alexander von
Humboldt of a South American man who sustained a child on
his breast for five months during the illness of his wife.</p>

<p>In the Australian, the belly is flatter, the pudendum if anything,
slightly more anterior, and the inguinal folds decidedly
steeper than in the European.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>One frequently has an opportunity, however, of observing a
youngster with a remarkably big abdomen, a condition known
in the bush by the name of “pot-belly.” Such a picture might
point to either plenty or to want. In good seasons, when
animal and vegetable diet is to be had in abundance, the younger
children soon acquire a “pot-belly” in consequence of ample
feeding and gorging. But, on the other hand, a distended
abdomen is more often found in consequence of malnutrition
and starvation, which the children have to suffer during bad
seasons of drought. The distention in this case is due to the
swelling of some of the large abdominal glands.</p>

<p>The same sufferings manifest themselves similarly in the
adults, and particularly in the aged. Among the latter one
only too often finds hungering creatures whose flesh has wasted
away to a mere parchment wrapped around the bones, living
skeletons in fact. In these cases, too, enlarged glands give rise
to an unhealthy nodular protuberance in the epigastric region.</p>

<p>Can one wonder if, under such conditions, a kindly club,
wielded by a more robust relative, puts the sufferer out of his
misery? It is during these trying times, too, that parents are
obliged to resort to extreme measures, so that they might sustain
the lives of their children. Driven to the verge of despair,
and visibly moved at the thought of it, a father must occasionally
make the pathetic and gruesome decision to slay one child
in order that another may be saved.</p>

<p>On account of his acting thus, when dire need compels him,
people, who should know better, often call the Australian
aboriginal a cannibal! Is this cannibalism? Have not shipwrecked
people of our own colour, when in a similar plight,
often been compelled to kill and eat one of their friends to save
themselves from starvation?</p>

brow-ridges—The iris—An unusual colour—The eye-sockets—The
nose and its aperture—Natural and artificial flatness—“Primitive
snout”—Prognathism—“Negative chins”—The ear.</p>

</div>

<p>When we look an aboriginal in the face, the first impression
it gives us is that of wildness and fierceness amounting often
to repulsiveness. There are, of course, appreciable differences
between different individuals, and often during a day’s journey
one encounters features which might be classed as decidedly
pleasing and almost European. We might even go so far as
to say that in some faces, especially those of the old women,
we might feel inclined to establish an analogy with classical or
historical types of our own colour. Such descriptions, however,
convey no more to the person who has never seen an aboriginal
than a statement like one, often heard, to the effect that the
features are of the “usual Australian type.”</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a little more exact description of the
facial appearance, let us assume that the individual we are
considering possesses all of the “Australian” features, and let
us analyze each of them separately. At the same time, we must
remember that probably no single individual exists in whom all
of these characteristics are present.</p>

<p>To help us better understand the various points we are about
to introduce, it will be advisable, whenever possible, to draw
into the discussion the morphological peculiarities of the bony
skeleton and skull, which immediately underlie the fleshy parts
of the face and head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>There is no doubt the eyes of an aboriginal largely account
for the wild appearance of his countenance, already alluded to.
These organs are deeply sunken in their sockets, which lie beneath
a projecting bony roof and bushy eyebrows. Nature in
this way protects the eyes against the scorching rays of the
southern sun by an effective screen, which lies above and before
them like the peak of a cap. For that matter, we ourselves
often instinctively endeavour to obtain a similar protection,
when we stare into a glaring light, by holding a hand against
the brows. Within the scope of this protection comes also, so
far as the aboriginal is concerned, prevention, to a certain
degree, of such accidental harm as might be caused by stakes
or brushwood, during an exciting hunt through bush or forest
land. The strong colour-contrast of the sclera against the
swarthy skin, and the active, searching movements of the eyes,
considerably help to intensify the sullen look.</p>

<p>In the fossil men of Gibraltar and Neanderthal, too, the eyes
were overlain by very massive, bony ridges, but in those people
the eyes stood further forward.</p>

<p>The supraorbital region is unquestionably one of the most
prominent, and at the same time most striking, features of the
Australian aboriginal’s face. The high degree of development
of the bony prominence, combined with a sloping forehead, are
primitive characteristics which he shares with no other living
race. Yet it is possible for a cultured people, like for instance
the Europeans, with high forehead, at times to show a strong
superciliary development. As opposed to this, one not infrequently
discovers an Australian with strong brow-ridges combined
with a comparatively full and steep forehead. But usually
the area occupied by these bony prominences can be differentiated,
from the forehead above it, by a dividing line or zone
of crowded foramina—the outlets of small blood-vessels. In
the aboriginal, the effect is intensified, not alone on account of
the usually receding forehead, but also because the root of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
nose is appreciably depressed between the eyes; and consequently
the glabella appears to project extraordinarily far outwards
(<a href="#plate03">Plate III</a>).</p>

<p>It was Thomas Huxley who first drew attention to the
analogy existing between the skull of the fossil Neanderthal
man and that of the Australian aboriginal. To quote the
words of that famous anthropologist, “a small additional
amount of flattening and lengthening, with a corresponding
increase in the superciliary ridge, would convert the Australian
brain case into a form identical with that of the aberrant
fossil.” Since those words were written, a number of other
fossil skeletons of men have been found, the examination of
which has confirmed Huxley’s observation upon the first Neanderthal
skull.</p>

<p>The substance of the supraorbital prominence consists of
massive bone. As in the fossil skulls, the sinuses lie behind
this mass, not far from the inner surface. It appears that this
colossal growth of bone takes place in early adult life; so far,
no superciliary ridges have been observed in children’s skulls.</p>

<p>Originally this great thickness of bone in the supraorbital
region of the Neanderthal calotte was regarded as a proliferation
of bony tissue caused by disease. Then it was proclaimed
to be a characteristic by which one might distinguish the skulls
of fossil from those of all living races. The subsequent recognition
of true supraorbital ridges or <i>tori</i> in the Australian completely
disproved both these hypotheses.</p>

<p>The feature is, so far as our present knowledge goes, essentially
masculine, and, as such, suggests a secondary origin
comparable to the tremendous supraorbital developments of bone
in the skull of the male gorilla. Professor D. J. Cunningham,
who investigated this subject thoroughly from a comparative
anatomical point of view, found “superciliary and supraorbital
elements” even more or less developed in the lower types of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
apes. A supraorbital prominence is rarely observed in the female
(<a href="#plate03">Plate III</a>, 2).</p>

<p>To return to the eye: the colour of the iris, in its normal
condition, is practically without exception dark brown. The
only exception to this rule, that has come under my personal
observation, was a young, full-blooded gin of the Mulluk
Mulluk tribe in the Daly River district, north Australia, whose
iris was a deep bluish grey.</p>

<p>There is great variety in the shape of the cavities which
hold the eye-balls of the Australian. The orbits are large, and
their outer margins, as in the Neanderthal type, very nearly
form a circle. According to Professor Klaatsch’s measurements,
the ratio of the maximum vertical to the maximum horizontal
diameter in the male Australian skull is as 39 millimeters is
to 40. As a rule, the eye-cavities in children are slightly depressed
horizontally, and occasionally this is also the case in
the skulls of females.</p>

<p>The orbit’s upper edge is very strong; and what is known
as the <i>internal angular process</i> of the frontal bone, in the
inner wall of the cavity, is very prominent in the Australian.
The last named characteristic is, however, also observed in the
skulls of Veddahs and other primitive people, as well as in those
of the anthropoids. But we must not forget, when dealing
critically with a skull, that an internal angular process may
not be so typical in the male as it is in the skulls of women
and children.</p>

<p>The <i>external angular processes</i> are often well developed, the
malar boundary being strong and broad, without the sharp edge
usually noticed in European skulls.</p>

<p>The <i>ethmoid</i> bone in the inner wall of the orbit is, as in
most of the primitive skulls, noticeably small.</p>

<p>The groove of the <i>lachrymal</i> bone, which <i>intra vitam</i> carries
the tear duct connecting eye with nose, is usually very pronounced
in the Australian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>In children’s skulls a supraorbital notch divides the upper
margin of the orbital cavity into two almost equal parts, the
outer of which has a well-defined edge.</p>

<p>In the nose and its aperture, we again recognize primitive
characteristics of considerable importance in the Australian.
We have already had occasion to notice how deeply the root
of the external organ seems to be retracted under the great
glabellar prominence of the forehead. A bridge in the true
sense of the word seems wanting, the nose consisting of a flabby
body at its point, above which lies a saddle-shaped depression
sloping imperceptibly into the retracted root beneath the
forehead. Not uncommonly one finds a number among the
males of all tribes whose noses are curved and give one the
impression of Jewish features; the type is rare among women
(<a href="#plate06">Plate VI</a>, 2).</p>

<p>The breadth of the nose is very great, and consequently the
nasal aperture in Australian skulls is of corresponding dimensions.
The width of the aperture often actually exceeds thirty
millimeters.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that these features are quite peculiar
to the Australian; they are also present in the fossil skulls of
Europe. If then we regard the latter as the ancestral stock,
from whom modern peoples have sprung, and, at the same time,
recollect that diverse admixtures of strain might have taken
place periodically, it would not be amiss to expect indications
of such primitive nose developments in the higher types of man.
That such do occur, we can every day verify for ourselves.</p>

<p>Apart from being a racial characteristic, the flat broad nose
is cultivated by many of the tribes. Mothers artificially flatten
the noses of their children when quite young by pressing upon
them with their fingers, and often repeating the process. It is,
therefore, often difficult to say whether a specially flat nose is
natural or is the result of cosmetic culture. The wearing of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
bone or stick through the septum would also tend to flatten and
widen the organ to an abnormal extent (<a href="#plate06">Plate VI</a>).</p>

<p>The nasal aperture of a modern European skull almost invariably
has sharp lateral margins, which unite at the base
behind a prominent bony spine; for reasons which will become
apparent below, we shall call this the inner boundary. In an
anthropoid, like the gorilla, however, the cavity is bounded on
its lower side by two ridges, which enclose a groove in front of
the large aperture. Converging upwards, these ridges, on either
side, unite to form the lateral margins below the nasal bones.
In the monkeys there is no indication of a well-defined boundary
at all, the lower surface of the cavity appearing more or less
smooth, whilst the spine, so prominent in man, is barely
recognizable.</p>

<p>In the Australian skull we often find an interesting transition
stage connecting these extremes, the inner margin being present
but associated with a pre-nasal groove at the base of the
aperture. Indeed, the sharp lateral margin is often found to
pass into a pre-nasal ridge which forms the anterior margin of
the groove. Such a condition is of considerable interest, since
it recalls a stage in our evolution, when the nose was closely
connected with the mouth part; that is to say, that a portion
now absorbed into the modern skull was originally the floor
of the nose, and helped to build up the alveolar process of the
upper jaw.</p>

<p>In fact, we are reminded of this condition when we look
upon the living aboriginal; for his nose seems to ride upon the
upper portion of his mouth, to which it seems rigidly attached,
after the pattern of an animal’s snout. We see the same sort
of thing in the European embryo during the first few months
of gestation.</p>

<p>This “primitive snout” is made the more conspicuous in the
Australian on account of the strong <i>naso-labial folds</i> in the
skin, one of which, on either side, encloses the angle of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
mouth in a semi-circular fashion. With us Europeans, the
elevating processes which our nose has undergone have tended
to reduce the depth of these folds, in the upper portions at any
rate. This elevating process, by the way, has largely been in
consequence of the recession our mandibular skeleton has
suffered (<a href="#plate05">Plate V</a>).</p>

<p>The jaws of the Australian are, like those of most of the fossil
skulls and of the Negroids, protubefent—a condition known
as <i>prognathism</i>. In the Tasmanians, too, the strong development
of the jaws, and of the teeth, has resulted in a general
fullness of the same region (<a href="#plate03">Plate III</a>, 2).</p>

<p>In aboriginal infants, one often finds the bony process, upon
which the teeth subsequently grow, to be directed forwards,
almost in a straight line with the floor of the nose. This
hereditary predisposition towards a horizontal development of
the alveolar region reminds one forcibly of features belonging
to the anthropoid apes.</p>

<p>Yet, generally speaking, it must be admitted, there is a great
variation in prognathism among the Australians.</p>

<p>In order to compare the degree of facial prognathism of the
skulls of different men, a method was devised by Fraipont:
The glabella is connected with the lambda by an imaginary
plane, and another plane erected at right angles to this at the
glabella. The latter plane usually cuts the alveolar plane at
about the first or second premolar, occasionally at the first
molar. Still another plane is imagined, extending vertically
from the most anterior point of the alveolar to the glabella-lambda
plane. Then the rectangular distance between the two
upright planes represents, after Fraipont’s method, the prognathism.
The maximum prognathism of the Australian, determined
by this means, is, according to Professor Klaatsch,
twenty-five millimeters, and the minimum eight.</p>

<p>Let us now enquire into the possible origin of prognathism
among the primitive races of mankind. We shall have to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
note, in the first place, of the large occipital development of
both the brain and the brain-box in the lower types of the
human species. In order to antagonize the downward pull of
this weight, the mandibular region has expanded and provides
the balancing moment about a fulcrum on the spine. With
this explanation fresh in our minds, we understand how the
development of the frontal region of modern peoples would
tend to modify the lower region of the face and establish the
condition known as <i>orthognathism</i>.</p>

<p>Prognathism is usually associated with a receding chin. By
elaborating the Fraipont method, Professor Klaatsch has added
another vertical plane at the most anterior point of the cutting
surface of the teeth. In primitive folks, like the Australians
and the fossil Neanderthals, the chin lies behind this plane and
is called a “negative chin”; in the Mongoloids (Malays, etc.)
the chin practically lies against the plane and is called a “neutral
chin”; and lastly, in the modern Europeans, the chin lies before
the plane and is known as a “positive chin.”</p>

<p>In the Tasmanians, the chin was bluntly rounded, without
much of the prominence so highly perfected in the modern
peoples.</p>

<p>The mental foramen is usually situated at a point below
and between the second bicuspid and first molar.</p>

<p>The Australian’s ear is large and longish, much the same in
general appearance as the European’s; the Negroid’s ear is
decidedly rounder. There is, however, no great racial variety
in the human ear; man has, like the rodents, retained the
primitive shape, whilst the monkeys have acquired more
specialized forms.</p>

<p>The small process, known as the tragus, which partially
covers the ear-hole, is mostly covered with bristly hairs in adult
men.</p>

<p>The dependent portion, or lobulus, which carries the earrings
of our European ladies and is often mutilated by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
lower races, is not as a rule interfered with by the Australians.
The custom of piercing the lobulus appears to be confined to
the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland. The hole is pierced
with a small pointed bone, after which a short cylindrical
wooden rod or bone is inserted, frequently removed and replaced
again, until the edge of the hole has healed. In the course of
time, a series of rods, of gradually increasing diameter, are
forced into the perforation, until a large pendant loop is
formed. Upon special occasions, short painted rods of wood,
two inches or more in diameter, are inserted into the loop.</p>

<p>The cheek bone, or zygomatic arch, is usually horizontal; but
it may curve upwards from the squamous bone, thence downwards
anteriorly. The <i>mastoid</i> process is comparatively small,
but it is often associated with an unusual thickness of the wall
of the ear-passage.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MOUTH</span></h2>

<p>The lips—The vault and hard palate—The teeth—Excessive wear of
grinding surfaces—Tooth-picks—Fourth molars—Dental rudiments—The
canines.</p>

</div>

<p>The Australian’s mouth is decidedly large, and his lips full.
The latter, especially of the children, are as often as not becomingly
arched and furnished with a shapely philtrum.</p>

<p>If we were to look into the mouths of a number of aboriginals
we would find considerable individual differences in the configuration
of the vault. In some instances the roof would
appear high and arched, in others low and flat. If, further, we
extended our observations in the direction of any differences
which might exist in the individual faculty of articulated
speech, relative to the variations in height already noted, our
efforts would be fruitless. It is very doubtful whether any
such connection between the height of the mouth and freedom
of tongue or speech does exist in the aboriginal’s case. But it
has been rightly pointed out that the hard palates of fossil
skulls are flatter than they are in those of modern races.</p>

<p>Perhaps the finest natural gift of the Australian (and the
same was true of the Tasmanian) is his strong set of ivory
white teeth. In the primitive tribes, living apart from civilization,
dental disease or caries is practically unknown. A common
feature, however, is that the teeth are ground down on a
level, to varying extents, depending upon the age of the individual
examined. In many cases, the biting and grinding
surfaces of the teeth have been worn to almost the alveolar
or gum-level of the jaws, leaving only the roots with short
truncated stumps to do the mastication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>This excessive wear of healthy teeth is mainly attributable
to the large quantities of sand contained in the everyday diet.
The aboriginal cooks nearly all his meals in hot ashes and
sand; it is unavoidable, therefore, to include an appreciable
quantity of gritty material in the articles which are consumed.
The aboriginal, furthermore, during the course of a meal,
might repeatedly call upon the strength of his teeth, as an
easy way of crunching bones of animals, and shell of molluscs
and crabs, and many other things. Casually one might take
notice of the fact that the teeth of the fossil of Gibraltar are
worn in the same remarkable way.</p>

<p>An aboriginal does not take any particular care of his teeth,
with the exception that after every meal, some considerable
time is devoted to the removal of any remnants of meat which
may have been retained. For this purpose, the dry seed-stalks
of grass and small twigs are generally used. The old Kukata
men were observed to possess permanent tooth-picks, consisting
of short pieces of wood sharpened at one end. For convenience
sake, they carried these, planted in their shaggy beards.</p>

<p>Should there be an aching tooth to cure, the native does it
by heating the point of a small stick in a fire and inserting it
into the cavity which is causing the trouble.</p>

<p>A most interesting circumstance in connection with the
dentition of the Australian is the comparatively frequent occurrence
of a fourth molar in the jaws. We know that in
European subjects the third molar or wisdom tooth is smaller,
and takes longer in coming to the surface than the other
molars; its development is certainly on the down-grade with
our kind; but the third molar of the aboriginal is strong and
lasting.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="plate04" style="max-width: 43.75em;">

<p>1. Aluridja woman. Note matted locks and
asymmetry of breasts.</p>

<p>2. Wongapitcha warrior, so-called Semitic type.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Even when a fourth molar cannot be found in toto, there is
often present, behind the third molar, a peculiar prolongation
of the alveolar groove, which seems to be indicative of a former
existence, in the earlier evolutional history of the Australian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
of such a tooth. Indeed, the occurrence of a fourth molar in
the human species, which in the aboriginal is certainly not
sporadic, must be looked upon as a character originally common
to the ancestral forms of both man and anthropoid. For this
reason, we must not be surprised to hear that a fourth molar
might occasionally be found in any race of man.</p>

<p>Professor W. L. H. Duckworth has described some small
dental rudiments on the alveolar surface of the upper jaw,
which might even suggest remnants of third premolars. Such
rudiments usually occur between the second bicuspid and the
first molar, and consist of dentine. If it can be proved that
we have before us true evidence of immature tooth-development,
the phenomenon suggests a dental formula similar to that of
some of the simians possessing three premolars. On the contrary,
the formations may be the remnant masses of temporary
milk teeth.</p>

<p>Supernumerary bicuspids are, it appears, not very often observed
in the Australian.</p>

<p>It is still questionable whether, as Charles Darwin suggested,
the ancestor of the human species has ever possessed extra large
eye-teeth or canines in any way resembling those of an anthropoid.
In the Talgai skull, referred to later, the canines certainly
seem abnormally large, but one could not be expected
to draw definite conclusions from a single specimen, especially
when it is known that, even among ourselves, we here and
there see persons whose canines are quite the same size as those
of the Talgai fossil.</p>

</div>

<p>Opinion is often expressed that the Australian has not sufficient
brains to completely fill his brain-box! Such a statement
is, of course, not in accordance with fact. A condition
known as <i>scaphocephaly</i> is, however, not infrequently observed
in the Australian skull, which gives one the impression of
insufficient inflation of the cranial vault as a whole. A sagittal
ridge is present which, with a little exaggeration, might be
likened to an inverted boat (<a href="#plate05">Plate V</a>). A similar frontal ridge
is also occasionally observed in the Negroid skull and some
of the fossil calvaria, but rarely in the modern European and
Asiatic races.</p>

<p>This median frontal ridge is not the result of any abnormal
thickening of bone locally, but anthropologists believe it may
be connected with the early fusion of the frontal suture. As
a matter of fact, the frontal suture is extremely rare in adult
primitive peoples’ skulls, and so far only three have been recorded
in the Australian by Dr. Ramsay Smith in specimens
from the Northern Territory; one case has been found in the
Tasmanian; and one or two in the Torres Strait Islanders. All
the other sutures in the calvarium seem to be less complicated in
the Australian than in the European and other more highly
developed types of man; the most complex is the lambdoid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
suture; and it often has one or more small <i>Wormian</i> bones
interposed within its course, which are, in all probability, connected
with the growth of the brain, and with the consequent
enlarging processes, which the enclosing bones have suffered.
An <i>os inca</i> is occasionally seen.</p>

<p>Although scaphocephalic skulls are not rare among the Australians,
we must not overlook the fact that occasionally we
find specimens, dead or alive, exhibiting sagittal curves in no
wise behind those of modern peoples. And this seems to have
been even more conspicuous in the case of the lost Tasmanians.</p>

<p>The Australian skull is remarkably narrow and long, in most
instances <i>dolichocephalic</i>. In the Tasmanians, the parietal
portion is considerably wider in proportion; the whole of that
region seems to be inflated, when compared with the frontal
portion. Whereas in the Australian we noticed a sagittal ridge,
a peculiar median sulcus is usually present in male skulls, running
along the line of the sagittal suture.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable uniformity in the contours of the male
Tasmanian skulls. They resemble the female Australian much
more than they do the male Australian, principally because the
adult male Australian skulls vary so.</p>

<p>We have already referred to the sloping forehead and frontal
region of the Australian skull; such is observed also in the
Tasmanian and, for that matter, in all primitive men whether
they be recent or fossil. But at the same time, one frequently
observes crania of these primitive people in which the contours
of the frontals are as steep as in any average European. The
last remark applies especially to the female skull, which even
might occasionally show a combination of a prominent forehead
with a primitive superciliary ridge. The two conspicuous
eminences of the forehead of the European skull, known as the
<i>tubera frontalia</i>, one of which is situated over either eye-socket,
are not developed in the Australian or Tasmanian.</p>

<p>The frontal bone of the Australian skull often lies in direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
contact with the <i>squamous</i> portion; this is, however, the case
in other primitive races also. The articulation between the
bones mentioned is effected by means of a process which the
squamous bone sends towards the frontal; the actual line of
contact measuring several millimetres. In other instances the
connecting process is replaced by a small epipteric bone. The
articulation may occur on one or both sides of the skull.</p>

<p>The bony tuberosity of the occipital bone, being part of a
muscle-attachment, varies appreciably in its position; its central
point is anthropologically styled the <i>external inion</i>. A similar
protuberance on the inner surface of the bone is the divisional
line between the great and small hemispheres of the brain; it
is called the <i>internal inion</i>. The internal inion is, as a rule,
situated lower than the external in the adult Australian; but
in female and immature skulls the two points are at about the
same level.</p>

<p>The angle which is contained by the occipital bone at the
inion, in a sagittal plane, is less in the Australian than in the
modern European skull. Many of the Australian skulls one
examines, therefore, seem to be unusually flattened at the base,
below the inion.</p>

<p>The cranial walls of no other race are so massive as those of
the Australian. It is particularly in the supraorbital and the
occipital regions that the bone is so thick; the thinnest portions
lie in the temporal and lower parietals; these remarks apply
principally to the adult male skulls. The consequent strength
of the aboriginal’s skull has almost become proverbial. Many
are the club-duels which tribal law and honour demand to be
fought. Upon these occasions the head is the mark. But also
in the settlement of his domestic affairs, when a serious offence
calls for punishment, the husband selects the head of his gin
for beating with the weighty nulla-nulla. Is it a wonder, then,
that one often finds the skulls of aborigines covered with dents,
which have resulted from such a battering? Occasionally death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
might follow such treatment; and a few cases stand on record
of blindness following the destruction of the centre of vision
by a blow from the club. So severe is the impact that often,
in the stillness of night, I have heard the falling of the blows
upon a disobedient gin’s head, although our camp might have
been some considerable distance off.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="plate05" style="max-width: 43.75em;">

<p>Wordaman man, profile and full-face.</p>

<p>Note <i>scaphocephaly</i>, great width of nose, and strong naso-labial fold.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This wonderful strength is largely due to the better development
of the compact tissue of the skull-bone, when compared
with that of the European. The external, as well as the
internal, laminae of the cranial wall are thicker than ours,
while, on the other hand, the intermediate layer, known as the
<i>diploë</i>, is thinner in the aboriginal’s skull. This condition
serves the double purpose of protecting the brain against the
mechanical injury referred to, as well as against the powerful
rays of a fierce southern sun.</p>

<p>In regard to the cubic capacity of the Tasmanian and Australian
skulls, we might accept as averages for the adult male
and female Australian skulls 1,290 and 1,845 cubic centimeters
respectively, and as similar averages for the Tasmanian,
1,315 and 1,155 respectively. The individual variations in the
adult male Australian skulls range from 1,630 to 1,040, and in
those of the opposite sex from 1,280 to 1,010 cubic centimeters.
The corresponding variations in male and female Tasmanian
skulls are from 1,465 to 1,140, and from 1,225 to 1,060 respectively.</p>

<p>There are, however, considerable variations in the capacity
of Australian skulls; many instances may be selected in which
the capacity is quite as good as that of an ordinary European
brain-box. On the other hand, cases have been recorded of
capacities not greater than 940 cubic centimeters in adult female
Australian skulls.</p>

<p>The brain of the Australian has not been studied to any
considerable extent. The first impression a layman receives,
upon beholding the brain of an aboriginal, is, perhaps, a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
disappointing. Assuming him to be a man of low intellect, he
expects to find a brain of inferior development. But such is
not the case. In fact, to any but the specialist, there seems
nothing to indicate a lowly intellectual capacity. The number
of convolutions is about the same as one finds in Europeans of
average intelligence; but the structure, as a whole, is, perhaps,
a little less complicated and less tortuous than we are accustomed
to see in our own sort. The large cerebral hemispheres
completely cover the cerebellum. Certain features, like the
operculum, are more strongly developed on the left side than
the right.</p>

<p>In some respects the Australian brain preserves important
characteristics, which indicate the genesis of the more modified
or more specialized conditions seen in the brain of modern man.
The length of the hemispheres and the small occipital development
are unquestionably extremely primitive characters, which,
among others, remind us of the common ancestry of man and
ape. In the brains of the more cultured peoples, processes are
at work, which are completely remodelling portions of the
important organ, and thereby making it more and more unlike
the anthropoid or simian brain. By such modifications in the
occipital region, the human brain is gradually ridding itself of
a feature strongly developed in the monkey’s brain, which has
been named the <i>sulcus lunatus</i>. German anthropologists call
this sulcus “<i>Affenspalte</i>,” which means “<i>Monkey-Cleft</i>,” i.e., a
cleft or sulcus in the posterior portion of the brain of primates,
which is strongly developed in the monkeys, but disappearing in
the brain of man. In the Australian’s brain, the <i>sulcus lunatus</i>
can often be more or less distinctly discerned, and its presence
there affords us valuable evidence when tracing the remnants
of the sulcus in the brains of other races, including those of the
modern Europeans.</p>

<p>The posterior lip of the <i>sulcus lunatus</i> is occasionally operculated
in the Australian’s brain. In the parieto-occipital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
region, the outer convolutions are depressed and covered by an
operculum-like flap; but this condition is also occasionally
observed in European examples.</p>

<p>Another simian feature, rarely seen in European brains, is
rather frequently found in Australian, in the shape of a <i>rhinal
fissure</i>. It should be observed, however, that the European
embryo clearly shows this fissure in the brain as it is developing.</p>

<p>The occipital bone varies in its appearance. The impressions
made upon the surface, where, during the life-time of an individual,
the strong muscles of the neck were attached, are, as a
rule, well developed. The minor <i>posterior-rectus</i> and <i>complexus</i>
muscles of the neck often leave deep hollows in the
occipital bone at the points of their insertions.</p>

<p>A bony process is often noticed in front of the big foramen,
which joins the occipital condyles; this is an atavistic condition,
by means of which an extra articulation is occasionally effected
between the occiput and vertebral column. The condyles vary
considerably in their elevation above the occipital bone. The
large foramen is mostly oval in shape, but often has a little
median notch in its posterior margin.</p>

<p>The Australian aboriginal is popularly spoken of as a blackfellow;
at times one even hears him referred to as a nigger!
Strictly speaking, the former appellation is not in accordance
with obvious fact, and the latter in addition is scientifically
grossly incorrect. The aboriginal is no more black than the
average modern European is white, and, apart from his darker
colour, he certainly has not many negroid features which we
do not also possess, at any rate more or less sporadically. Under
normal conditions, the colour of the Australian is a velvety
chocolate-brown, somewhat lighter or more coppery in the
female than in the male. The skin of a newly-born piccaninny
is very much paler, with a distinct tint of fleshy red about it,
which many people maintain reminds one of the skin of young
murines, as it appears before it developes fur. For this reason,
too, the inexperienced observer often accuses an aboriginal
mother of infidelity; the colour of the infant’s skin, when
compared with that of its parent, indeed suggests a mixing of
her blood with that of another lighter coloured race. The
child’s skin, however, soon darkens in colour; and, within a
few weeks, attains a shade not appreciably different from that
of the adults of its tribe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>Apparent gradations in colour are occasionally observed
among different members of one and the same tribe. As with
ourselves, circulatory disorders are not absent among the
aborigines, and such materially affect the quality of colour in
the aboriginal’s skin. Simple anaemia, or even a temporary
blanching of the tissues, through nervousness or fright during
the time of an examination, will affect the appearance of the
skin. In the same way, full-bloodedness, or a passing flush,
will deepen the shade, the injection of blood into the underlying
tissues being clearly noticeable through the epidermis.
Pathological conditions like jaundice are also frequently
developed in the aborigines, and impart to their skin a sickly
ashen hue; in this case the yellow colour of the conjunctiva
usually indicates the disorder. The likelihood of any such conditions
being present should be carefully investigated before
applying the standard colour tables of modern anthropologists.</p>

<p>The oldest systems of colour-classification divided the races
of man into five groups—the white, the yellow, the red, the
brown, and the black. But nowadays, even the layman knows
that such hard and fast divisions are impossible. We find
that among individuals of one particular race, whatever its
so-called, and somewhat arbitrary, colour might be, there
exist noticeable variations in shade. Red Indians have yellow
or brown skins almost as frequently as a genuine red; the
“white” races of Europe often have so dark a “complexion”
that they are in reality brown; and the skin of a negro at
times has a distinctly reddish or brownish hue.</p>

<p>Early anthropologists thought that the “dust or tawny”
colour was due to the accumulation of carbon in the external
layers of the integument. But since the introduction of the
microscope, which made the study of thin sections of human
skin under great magnification possible, it was found that the
colour is due to living cells, which carry pigment in their
protoplasm, and are more or less migratory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>In the Australian aboriginal, these pigment-cells lie quite
superficially in the skin. Some years ago Professor Klaatsch,
of Heidelberg University, when in Australia, managed to
obtain the corpse of an aboriginal, which he consigned to a
large tank holding an ordinary preserving fluid. Hermetically
sealing the lid of the tank, the Professor shipped the specimen
to Europe, where it was to be dissected. Some months later,
I joined him at Breslau University, and together we opened the
tank. Imagine our surprise when we beheld what one might
describe as an anthropological contradiction—a “white blackfellow!”
It took us some time to recognize in the form in
front of us that of the aboriginal we had seen in Australia.
What had happened was that, during the continued movement
of the preserving solution during the transport, the superficial
layers of the skin had been removed, and, with them, the colour
too. In other parts, the skin had blistered and become detached,
leaving more or less adherent strips of epidermis in which the
colouring matter could be recognized.</p>

<p>I have seen a similar condition of things in corpses of
aborigines, in the remoter districts of the Australian bush, where
the dead are placed to rest on artificial platforms in the branches
of trees. When, during the processes of decomposition, the skin
peels off, and is washed away by the rain, the corpse assumes a
pinkish white colour, resembling the body of a white man, some
time dead. No doubt it was on this account that, in the early
days of European settlement, it was a general belief among the
aborigines that the white man was one of their own dead
warriors returned to life in a different colour. We have a
classical example in the experience of the escaped convict,
William Buckley, who lived for thirty-two years among the
natives of Victoria, the latter regarding him as their dead chief
returned to life transformed. It is quite possible that this belief,
which is so common among the tribes, originated from the fact
that the natives themselves had observed, as Professor Klaatsch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
and I did, that the decomposing bodies of their dead might,
under certain conditions, become very much lighter in colour.</p>

<p>Throughout the Northern Kimberley district the natives
maintain that a dead tribesman will “jump up all-the-same
whitefellow” in colour.</p>

<p>A singular case, illustrative of the shallowness of pigmentation
in the epithelium of an aboriginal’s skin, was reported
from Canowie Sheep Station by the late Rev. Tenison Woods.
A native, suffering from an obstinate skin disease, was “dipped,”
like a sheep, in a solution containing soft soap, tobacco, and
arsenic, the last-named in the proportion of one ounce to the
gallon of water. The native became very ill, lost his hair, and
his finger and toe-nails. Eventually he became better, but his
skin peeled off. He was then described as “presenting the
appearance of a magpie during the time the process of decortication
was going on.” Finally his skin became “smooth and
as glossy as marble.”</p>

<p>In pemphigoid skin-eruptions, when blister-like bullae develop
over different parts of the body, the lesions left in the skin for
a while are pinkish and unpigmented. Scars resulting from a
cut or burn remain red for a considerable time, but eventually
turn the same uniform colour as the rest of the skin.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions, one may often find patches of
pigment on mucous surfaces of the inner lips and mouth. The
pathological condition known as leucoderma is, on the other
hand, rather frequently observed among the different tribes of
Australia. I have seen natives, both in the north and south
of this continent, whose skin over certain areas was devoid of
pigment; the hands and feet seem particularly prone to be thus
affected.</p>

<p>So much for the seat of the pigmentation. If we now enquire
into the actual complexion, or colour-tint, of the aboriginal’s
skin, the question is not so easily satisfied as one might have
thought. The colour is, of course, brown—a soft, velvety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
brown, like chocolate. Scientists tell us it is about the same
as tint No. 3 of the colour scheme on Plate III, Notes and
Queries on Anthropology, London. But the matter is not so
simple as one might be led to believe. To begin with, we
have not a homogeneous colouration before us. If, for instance,
we wanted to paint a picture of an aboriginal, we would mix
a fundamental chocolate-brown to deck the surface with; to
obtain the shade of the back we should have to mix a blue or
green with the brown; whereas the cheeks and chin would
require a yellow or red. The intensity of pigmentation varies
to a noticeable degree; it is deepest on the back and neck, and
along the folds of the skin. The soles and palms are always
very much lighter in colour than the rest of the body.</p>

<p>Environment plays an important role, because a native’s skin
has the remarkable power of what might be termed complimentary
colour-adaptation, as a result of which a hard and fast
definition, or fixing, of the shade is practically impossible. For
this same reason it is conceivable why the sombre hue of the
hunter’s skin becomes neutralized by the sallowness of the arid
Central Australian scrub, as well as by the deeply-shaded
verdure of the tropical jungle. Upon a clear day, with an
open, blue sky, an aboriginal always appears dark or dingy,
while on a dull and cloudy day, his skin is more of a chocolate-brown;
when he is swimming in the open sea, his colour may
even become coppery and seem not much darker than that of a
Javanese.</p>

<p>The adaptable tone-characteristics of their skin are well-known
to the natives themselves, not only while in the hunting
field and on the warpath, but also on the playground. At
Opparinna, in the Musgrave Ranges, children were seen indulging
in a game resembling “hide and seek,” and often, in
an endeavour to avoid the keen eye of the “seeker,” one would
duck in amongst the boulders of granite and imitate the rust-coloured
contours of a boulder to perfection.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>We know that the climate has an important bearing upon
the subject of pigmentation in all races. Most of us have had
our faces, hands, and other exposed parts of our body bronzed
when holiday-making at the seaside. If we come straight from
indoor life in the city, we might, in addition, find our skin
develop a badly blistered condition known as sunburn. Yet
the bushman, the coach-driver, or the sailor, who, by long
exposure, has acquired a more or less permanent tan, can bask
with impunity in the severest rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Exactly the same processes take place in the coloured man’s
skin. When cruising about the north coast, I frequently had
occasion to observe that my Malay crew were more bronzed
above than below the belt. This was obviously caused through
continued exposure to the tropical sun, since during the heat of
day they would work, or lie about on deck, wearing nothing
else than a serong hanging from their waist.</p>

<p>When aborigines are taken from their wild outdoor life, and
kept under European conditions, more or less confined, their
skin becomes unquestionably lighter; this is particularly noticed
in their faces.</p>

<p>These phenomena indicate to us the method Nature adopts
in protecting our skin, and with it our system, against scorching
rays of the sun; and we also realize why it is that the coloured
man can endure the disadvantages of a tropical climate so much
better than we.</p>

<p>The same phenomena might also be made responsible for the
wonderful absence of pigment in the skin of modern white
peoples of European origin. There is no doubt, the great Ice
Age and the living in caves and shelters (and huts) were the
essential factors which ultimately established the “white” skin
in man. In this hypothesis, we naturally assume that our
Diluvial or earlier Tertiary ancestor had a moderately dark-coloured
skin, which protected him against the tropical sun,
which Geology has taught us, shone over Europe at the beginning
or middle of that great period.</p>

aborigines—Grey hair—Baldness—The beard and methods of

</div>

<p>Let us proceed with a discussion of the aboriginal’s hair. As
in the youthful individuals of most races of man, including
the European, the Australian is born with a rudimentary, short
body-hair, known as the <i>lanugo</i>. This growth covers practically
all surfaces of the child’s figure, but is thickest on the back.</p>

<p>The colour of this infantile coating of hair is not, as one
might have expected, black, but fair, and casts a pretty golden
sheen over the sombre skin. In later adult life this growth
of hair becomes stronger, and darkens to complete blackness.
In ripe old age, the hairs turn grey.</p>

<p>Many of the old men have a remarkable hairiness of the
body, amounting almost to a <i>hypertrichosis</i>. In these cases
the hairs are up to an inch long, and cover especially thickly
the back, the chest, the thighs, and buttocks (<a href="#plate07">Plate VII</a>, 1).
Amongst the women quite pretentious beards are of rather
frequent occurrence (<a href="#plate03">Plate III</a>, 2).</p>

<p>With regard to the hair which covers the scalp, we find that,
in the majority of cases, it is wavy. It is by no means uncommon,
however, to find the Australian’s hair distinctly frizzy;
straight hair is least frequently observed. The male aboriginal
generally wears his hair in long loose curls; often these are
matted together artificially with grease and red ochre into long,
pendant, sausage-like masses. In the central region of Australia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
the men pull out the hair growing on the upper portion
of the forehead, each hair being removed separately. A hair-string
band is worn over the cleared portion of the forehead,
and this, at the same time, keeps back the locks of hair. Very
often, in the central as well as in the northern districts, the
hair thus tied back is worked up with a pad of emu feathers
into a chignon, which is tied round and round with human
hair-string (<a href="#plate09">Plate IX</a>). The women are frequently asked to
cut their hair short, and to deliver the clippings to their husbands,
who work them up into coils of string, out of which they
subsequently fashion hair belts and a variety of other articles in
daily use. Occasionally one sees an aboriginal whose hair stands
about his head after the type of a Struwwelpeter, or it may hang
from the scalp like a mop. The last-named types were more
plentiful on the north coast than in central Australia, but a
number of cases were recorded among the Aluridja and Wongapitcha.</p>

<p>The men of the same west-central tribes decorate their hair
with wooden pins whose surfaces they cut longitudinally over
certain sections, so that the shavings, which form, curl outwards
but still remain attached to the rod. The ornaments which go
by the name of “<i>elenba</i>” remind one of trimmed skewers occasionally
seen in butcher-shops. One or two of them are worn
long at the back of the head (<a href="#plate09">Plate IX</a>, 2), or a number of
them short, as a fringe above the forehead. The women of the
same districts try to make their hair look attractive by attaching
to the tips of the matted locks numerous seed-capsules of the
Bloodwood eucalyptus. The hairs are rammed into the open
ends of the seeds and kept there by small plugs of wood or
blebs of resin. The little ornaments dangle about the forehead
and shoulders and are known as “<i>dindula</i>” The seeds of the
Currajong are similarly used. Vide <a href="#plate06">Plate VI</a>, 2.</p>

<p>The colour of the adult Australian’s hair is almost invariably
black, but often of different intensities over different parts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the scalp. When a hair is pulled and examined under magnification,
the part which had been embedded in the follicle is not
infrequently discovered to be colourless or brownish.</p>

<p>By far the most remarkable, and genetically perhaps the most
important, subject in connection with the colour of the Australian
aboriginal’s hair is the juvenile <i>blonde</i>. In 1903, I
first came across a number of children of the Ulparidja group
of the Wongapitcha, in the Tomkinson Ranges, who had heads
of hair of a flaxen colour. Since then, I have seen many similar
cases among the Aluridja, in the Lilla Creek district, several
Wongapitcha from south of the Musgrave Ranges, at Ooldea,
and a limited number among the western Arunndta, on the
Finke River, south of the MacDonnell Ranges. The colour of
these children’s hair varied from a straw-yellow, through light
brown, to dark brown (<a href="#plate10">Plate X</a>, 1).</p>

<p>It appeared that, towards the age of puberty, the shade
became visibly deeper; after which it gradually changed to dark
brown or black. This change of colour I have recently been
able to watch very closely in the hair of two young gins who
have been under daily observation for over four years.</p>

<p>Among the adults, such blondes are unknown; two or three
cases of brown hair in grown-up persons, however, came under
our observation among the Aluridja, west of the Finke River.</p>

<p>True albinism has not been authoritatively established, as
existing among the Australian aboriginals. The case of a young
woman was reported from the Depôt on the Victoria River,
who is said to have been quite “white,” and to have had “red”
eyes. This albino, I was informed, was photographed by the
local constable shortly before she died in 1921.</p>

<p>Erythrism, too, is practically unknown; the only cases of the
latter on record are four from the Tully and Bloomfield Rivers,
discovered by Dr. Walter Roth. Red hair is, however, not
appreciated by the aborigines, who incline to hold it to ridicule.</p>

growth of hair covering the body.</p>

<p>2. Old Yantowannta man, showing peculiar

</figure>

<p>When, therefore, we consider the likely significance of fair-haired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
aborigines, from an anthropological standpoint, we cannot
ignore the claims of atavism. Noticing the phenomenon so
abundantly developed, as it has been our good fortune recently
to record, one is inclined to behold in it a primitive feature,
which was originally typical of the ancestral hordes from whom
the aboriginal Australian has sprung. This assumption is
strengthened by the light colour of the lanugo regularly observed
in the children.</p>

<p>The question arises whether the dark colour of the Australian’s
skin (and hair) is entirely a secondary development
due to climatic influences. The superficial nature of the pigmentation
in the aboriginal’s skin is in support of such reasoning.
It is known that the hair of some Arctic explorers, after a
protracted sojourn in the frigid zones, has turned from dark to
fair; and the same has been reported of alpine guides. We shall
see presently that there is evidence of great antiquity of man
in Australia; his occupation of the land dating back in all
probability to the early Tertiary period. Geology teaches us
that the climate has fluctuated considerably since and before
that time. Consequently, it is quite within reason to assume
that, in the earlier days of his racial existence, there may have
been no need for any considerable accumulation of pigment cells
within his skin, as a means of safeguarding his system against
a sun, anything like so severe as is nowadays reigning over
Australia. From later Tertiary times onwards, however, the
climate of central and northern Australia has been continuously
hot or tropical.</p>

<p>We are further strengthened in our theory by the fact that
the hair of the Tasmanians is known to have been generally
lighter in colour than that of the Australians. Sydney Hickson
even described the Tasmanian hair as light golden brown in
colour. Tasmania has, we know, since the later Tertiary at
all events, enjoyed a decidedly colder climate than Australia
proper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>One point remains unexplained; namely, why the occurrence
of light-coloured hair among Australian children should be
geographically restricted. Apart from the tribal groups in
central Australia, which I have mentioned, I know of no other
record except one by Professor Klaatsch from a coastal district
in Queensland.</p>

<p>The hair of an aboriginal turns grey at a riper old age than
is the case of the European’s. It seems, moreover, that the hair
of the women retains its colour longer than that of the men.</p>

<p>Baldness is comparatively rare among the aborigines; only a
limited number of cases have come before the writer’s personal
notice.</p>

<p>The old Arunndta men are very particular about their appearance.
When one is stricken with baldness, he constructs a
pad, resembling a skull cap, out of emu feathers, which he ties
on top of his head with human hair-string and wears regularly
to hide the bareness of his scalp. He refers to this feather-wig
as “<i>memba</i>.” Aluridja men adopt a similar fashion, but call
the article “<i>lorngai</i>” (<a href="#plate08">Plate VIII</a>).</p>

<p>The men all over Australia, as a rule, can produce quite
comely beards, but the methods they adopt of dressing them
vary according to locality. In the River Murray and other
southern districts, long square full-beards were the vogue. The
Yantowannta and other tribesmen of the Cooper’s Creek and
Lake Eyre region turn the point of the beard back upon itself
into a loop, and, by winding fur-string around it, keep it fixed
in that fashion (<a href="#plate07">Plate VII</a>, 2). North of the MacDonnell
Ranges, and on some of the islands off Arnhem Land, the older
men keep the upper lip clean by pulling out the hairs one by one.
Along the north coast, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the
Buccaneer Archipelago, the men over a certain age are allowed
to singe off, or shave with a sharp chip of stone or shell, the
entire beard including the upper lip. The women of the King
Sound tribes are required to help the men remove the hairs; a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
man will lie for hours, with his head upon his lubra’s lap, whilst
she busies herself pulling the hairs from her husband’s chin.
The old men of the Cambridge Gulf tribe twist each end of the
moustache and surround it with a cylindrical layer of beeswax,
from which the tips project on either side like the hairs of a
paint brush. The beard is divided into two equal bundles of
hairs, the ends of both of which are treated in the same way as
the moustache. On some of the islands of the Buccaneer Archipelago,
the men shave the upper portion of the moustache below
the nose, leaving only a narrow fringe of hairs, immediately
above the margin of the upper lip.</p>

</div>

<p>Having satisfied ourselves in regard to some of the principal
somatic characteristics of the Australian aboriginal, we shall
proceed to discuss briefly his likely origin. In the present
absence of more material facts relating to his ancestry, and of
a more thorough comparative knowledge of races in general, we
are lamentably handicapped in this direction, and many of our
conclusions are necessarily theoretical.</p>

<p>So far as possible, we shall take into consideration his present
relationships to other living races and peoples, as well as his
affinities with the ancient hunting peoples, who inhabited various
parts of the world in bygone eras, and are now only known in
a fossilized condition.</p>

<p>This introduces the geological element of time—hundreds of
thousands, yea, millions perhaps, of years have passed since man
left records of his being; definite traces have been found, embedded
in the same deposits as contain the mammoth, on the
one hand, and the Diprotodon, on the other.</p>

<p>The evidences of pre-historic and fossil men in the Old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
World are too numerous and well-known to need elucidation
here; we shall confine our attention to Australian records.</p>

<p>Some years ago a specimen was submitted to me for identification
which had been found in Pleistocene (or Pliocene?)
gravels S.S.E. of the Tennant’s Creek district. It was so completely
petrified and “stony” looking that the organic origin
was doubted, but a thin section viewed under the microscope
revealed the true structure of bone. After cleaning the fragment
thoroughly, I recognized it as portion of a human skull,
viz. the posterior half of the left parietal. The anterior fracture
is vertical and at about the centre of the parietal eminence; the
thin squamous edge is also broken away. The lambdoidal
border is still quite characteristic and shows the complex nature
of the parieto-occipital suture. Both the external and internal
surfaces are rough and pitted through exposure, age, and mineral
precipitations, but the temporal ridge is still discernible and
can be traced posteriorly right up to the parieto-occipital suture.
There is no indication of a parietal foramen. The bone is thick
about the posterior inferior angle, but the groove of the lateral
sinus has broken away. The specimen, when struck, has a clear
metallic ring, like that of earthenware or porcelain. When
treated with acid, the surfaces as well as the “bone-substance”
effervesced briskly, proving that a thorough intermolecular substitution
of organic matter by mineral was in progress. This
calvarium, fragmentary though it is, is of considerable importance
from a prehistory point of view, since it gives us
another definite link in the somewhat meagre chain of evidence
which has been established in connection with the geological
antiquity of man in Australia.</p>

<p>The most important find of an extinct Australian type was
made at Talgai, in south-eastern Queensland, as far back as
1884, in the shape of a fairly well preserved skull; but it was
not until a few years ago that a description of it was published
by Dr. S. A. Smith. Although no other bones were discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
in association with the skull, numerous remains of extinct
creatures like the Diprotodon, the Nototherium, and horny
reptiles have been unearthed not many miles remote from the
site of the interesting discovery. Dr. Smith sums up his observations
as follows: “This fossil human skull of a not yet
adult Proto-Australian presents the general picture of a cranium
similar in all respects to the cranium of the Australian of
to-day, combined with a facial skeleton of undoubtedly Australian
type, in the palate and teeth of which there are to be
found, in conjunction with the most primitive characters found
in modern skulls, certain characters more ape-like than have
been observed in any living or extinct race, except that of
Eoanthropus.”</p>

<p>Other less convincing discoveries have been recorded in the
shape of human and dingo bones from the Wellington Caves,
human remains and artefacts from beneath the basalts of Victoria,
and the fossil footprints of an aboriginal in the upper
Tertiary beds of Warrnambool.</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, that sufficient facts have been forthcoming
to prove that man was in existence at any rate in late
Tertiary times; and since he was then perfectly developed, it
would not seem unreasonable to assign to him a very much
greater antiquity.</p>

<p>During these long ages, tectonic forces, and the ever active
denuding agents of the atmosphere, in all their phases, have
wrought considerable transfigurations in the surface of the
globe. Some portions of the earth’s crust have been swallowed
by the ocean, whilst others have been wrenched from the depths
by upheaving processes. Thus the geography of our present
world would be a <i>terra incognita</i> to the earliest progenitors of
the human kind, who lived in the dim dawn of man’s ascending
tendencies, while, on the other hand, we would require a new
army of intrepid explorers to pave the way for civilization if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
we were suddenly placed back into the world as it stood in the
beginning of primeval days.</p>

<p>Old land connections then existed between entities which
now are parted by abysmal depths. Such evidence of once-existing
continental links is afforded by what has been termed
a “biological consanguinity” between organic creations on both
sides of gaps now occupied by ocean water.</p>

<p>There is no novelty about all this. Our best scientists have
long recognized that such connections have existed beyond all
doubt. They become evident when one enquires into the present
geographical distribution of botanical and zoological species, and
when one correlates geological strata in different parts of the
world, on the basis of palæontological evidence contained in
them.</p>

<p>The same principles apply when we consider the probable
original home of man, and the subsequent migrations and racial
evolutions of the pristine hordes, which followed.</p>

<p>That once a chain of land linked together the shores of
Australia, South Africa, and India seems certain. The continental
masses, which in past eras supplied this link, zoologists
have christened <i>Lemuria</i>, while geologists refer to the lost land
as <i>Gondwana</i>. It is somewhere within the area once occupied
by this submerged continent, perhaps not far remote from Australia,
that we must look for the cradle of the species <i>Homo</i>.
Although most of the evidence has been irretrievably lost to
scientific investigation, much might yet be expected from any
of the contiguous continents or islands in this region, upon
which occur Tertiary or later sedimentary formations. The
discovery of the oldest fossil, which appears to be human—the
<i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>—in Java, was by no means accidental.
Professor Dubois, before leaving for that island to undertake a
fossil-hunting expedition there, declared that in all probability
he would discover the remains of a primitive creature related
to man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>From some point, then, upon this ancient, vanished continent,
perhaps no great distance north of our present Australia, we
believe migrations of the earliest representatives of the human
species took place. The directions in which these migrations
took place would be governed according to the lie of the land
as it was then determined by the impassable waters of the ocean.
In all probability, the families or groups wandered in various
directions, at first keeping more or less in contact and on
friendly terms with each other, but as time, and eventually
ages, wore on, these migratory groups, by selective culture, environment,
climate, and, maybe, sundry other causes, became
differentiated into peculiarly distinct strains, all of which we
are nowadays able to reduce to three fundamental races.</p>

<p>One of these migrations was along a western course, which
led the wandering groups into the region now represented by
the continent of Africa. This established the Negroid element.</p>

<p>Another strain moved northwards and spread itself, like the
rays of a rocket, across the land now known as Asia. Some of
these “rays” reached what is now Lapland, while others found
their way, via the region of modern Esquimaux Land, across
to what we now call North America. This march evolved the
Mongoloids.</p>

<p>Yet another body of primitive hunters, who interest us most,
worked their way north-westwards, on a course between the
former two, and took possession of any portions of the dry land
of the globe, the present relics of which are India, south-western
Asia, and Europe.</p>

<p>Then came the catastrophe! The exact period is not determined.
It must have happened since the advent of the “human”
type, but there the evidence fails. Upheavals or subsidences of
land usually take an age to make themselves noticeable. It is
scientifically established that the close of the Triassic period
was characterized throughout the world by great tectonic
changes. Beds of rock were faulted to lofty heights on one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
side, and to dizzy depths on the other. The height of the Blue
Mountains plateau of New South Wales is evidence of such
upheaval, whilst the broken coastline, with its “drowned” rivers
and myriads of islands along the north-west of Australia, together
with the coastal fringe of coral reefs along the north,
are all evidences of comparatively recent subsidence <i>en bloc</i>.</p>

<p>By these processes Australia was gradually isolated from its
former land-connections, but, being near to the original home
of man, it is only natural to suppose that the land was peopled.</p>

<p>From that time on Australia remained, whether as an island
continent or a group of associated islands does not concern us
here, isolated from the rest of the world. The original inhabitants
whiled away their time in comparative ease. They had
nothing to fear. Their former companions who had, through
their nomadic migrations, been so far removed from them,
would, no doubt, have now posed as formidable rivals, if the
barriers had not come between. Until the recent arrival of
the European explorers and settlers, and the periodic visitations
to the north coast by Malay bêche-de-mer fishers, this great
Southern Land had remained the undisputed property of the
comparatively sparse progeny of the first primitive possessors.</p>

<p>There were no ferocious animals to molest these early prehistoric
Australians. Apart from a few dangerous, but usually
non-aggressive, reptiles, the large animals were almost without
exception of the ancient marsupial order, and, although perfectly
harmless, offered excellent opportunity for the chase.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that the primitive hordes could roam at
large in a congenial climate, and under peculiar conditions,
which were everywhere much the same; and, in their subsequent
wanderings, they met only with people of their own descent
and inclinations. In consequence, they were spared many of
the bloody brawls and conflicts, which the competitive waves of
culture continually showered upon the other hordes that were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
struggling northwards under decidedly more adverse conditions
of climate.</p>

<p>The great struggle for existence did not make itself felt so
keenly to the ancient Australians because they were strictly
insulated, and thus kept outside the sphere of exotic influence
and interference; their only troubles amounted to an individual
club-duel, or occasionally an inter-tribal warfare, which evoked
more irate words than actual blood drawn by their sharply-pointed
spears.</p>

<p>So the Australian has remained just what he was ages ago.
And on that account the evolution of his pristine contemporaries,
who were seized by the flood wave of culture, becomes
the more comprehensible, when we measure the differences, but
recognize the affinities, existing between the extremes. A line
drawn across the map of the world indicating, so far as it is
at this stage possible, the areas whose populations show, or before
their extinction showed, the strongest affinities with him
will represent roughly the direction of migration and incidentally
of evolution of the Australoid strain.</p>

<p>This line of anthropological relationship connects the Australian
(including the Proto-Australian) with the Veddahs and
Dravidians of India, and with the fossil men of Europe, from
whom the Caucasian element has sprung. In other words, the
Australian aboriginal stands somewhere near the bottom rung
of the great evolutional ladder we have ascended—he the bud,
we the glorified flower of human culture.</p>

<p>In the living Australian then, we see the prototype of man
as he appeared in Europe in the Stone Age. Australia has upon
other occasions proved to be extraordinary in a scientific sense.
The kangaroo is known only in the petrified condition in the
Tertiary deposits in other parts of the world. The <i>Zamia</i>,
which is still found living in Australia, is a conspicuous plant
of the coal-measures in every other country. The ornamental
mollusc, known as <i>Trigonia</i>, had been regarded as extinct until<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
it was re-discovered in Australia. Most of the great river
systems of central Australia have had their day; they have
flourished in the past; yet, occasionally, after a prolific downpour,
their dry courses swell temporarily to majestic streams.
And, lastly, we see in the aboriginal yet another palæontological
overlap—a living fossil man—the image of ourselves, as we
appeared many ages before we learned to record the history of
our progress, and of the world in general.</p>

<p>When one wades more deeply into the subject, only skimmed
above, the following points suggest themselves to one: Our line
of racial development was very early dissociated from the Mongoloid
and Negroid lines; and geographically it ran between
the latter two. There are considerable racial differences between
the other races and the Australoids, the most highly
specialized and cultured division of which is now represented
by the modern Caucasian. The last-named deductions are entirely
supported by the shallowness of the pigmentation in the
aboriginal’s skin, and by the fair hair of children found among
certain tribes of central Australia. In fact, the colour question,
so far as the Australian aboriginal is concerned, is a relative
conception, the difference in the amounts of pigment in his skin
and in the “white” man’s being in all probability due to
climatic influences extending over long periods of time. It is
doubtful whether the primitive Australoid or the Proto-Australian
possessed a skin so dark as that of the present-day Australian.
We may now understand why it is that the quarter-blooded
progeny derived from the union of a half-blooded
aboriginal woman with a European father is always lighter in
colour than its mother, and the octoroon lighter still. Unions
further on the European side produce children practically
white; and no case is on record where the colour in a later
generation reverted to the darker again. The latter, we know,
happens only too often when there is a taint of Negroid blood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
running in a family, even though the mixing of race took place
generations back.</p>

<p>Apart from its great scientific significance, this matter is of
considerable social and national interest to citizens of Australia,
and we might well ask ourselves: “Are we justified in referring
to the half-blooded aboriginal, with European parentage on one
side, as a half-caste, or in even stigmatizing him as a bastard?”</p>

<p>It had been talked among the old men for some time past that
the lubra Maiyarra was giving cause for suspicion. Her husband
Pitjala agreed; to his knowledge there had been no occasion
for her to leave his camp for some moons past. His mother,
old Indarrakutta, had told him that when she and Maiyarra
were gathering roots down by the Womma waterhole, many of
the gum trees were covered with manna and they partook freely
of the sweet meal, which, as he knew, does not often come to
their district. The old woman had cautioned the girl and
growled at her when she did not obey, because she knew
Maiyarra was of the Yalliadni clan and should not be allowed
to eat the manna. This disobedient gin had, however, not
eaten much before she became sick and was obliged to lie in
the hot sand of the creek where the bullrushes stand. Indarrakutta
had stood aghast, Pitjala explained to the old men, when
unexpectedly disturbing a snake from the bullrushes, she observed
that the creature, in gliding over the ground, touched
the body of Maiyarra with its tail and, in its great haste to
disappear, had left portion of its glossy slough beside her.
“<i>Yakai</i>,” gasped the men, as if from a single mouth, “then it
is clear the ever wakeful spirit of Womma has caught the
neglectful Maiyarra sleeping and it is certain she is with child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>Such was the history of the case as narrated to us. It
corroborated previous observations from central and northern
tribes. The recognition of maternity is not connected primarily
with any conjugal liberties a husband or number of tribal
husbands may be privileged to enjoy, but more with the recollection
of any accidental contact with an object by which it is
supposed a spirit child can enter the body of a woman. The
spiritual ingress may take place in a variety of ways, but as
often as not it is believed to be by means of a hollow object
of some description. In the present instance it was a snakeskin.
On the Victoria River the gins have a dread of the
whirlwind, thinking that if such should pass over one of them,
a spirit child would immediately enter the woman. In the
Cambridge Gulf country, young women very reluctantly go
into a water hole in which lilies are growing, fearing that as
they step over the leaves, which are hollow, a similar fate may
overtake them.</p>

<p>In the ancestral days of the Larrekiya in the Port Darwin
district, for instance, it is believed that a baby boy was once
seen to spring from the burrow of a rabbit bandicoot; whence
he had come no one knew. He was invited to come to the
Larrekiya camp and live with them, but he refused. Some time
after, when the boy had become a man, he was again met by the
tribe, who once more invited him to their camp; but he declined
as before. Thereupon the men became angry and dragged him
to a waterhole, and threw him in. The stranger immediately
sank, and five bubbles of air rose to the surface as he disappeared.
The men sat down and watched the water, when
suddenly the man’s face reappeared. The Larrekiya hurled a
spear at him, and he was killed because they knew he had no
father and no mother and was the accomplice of the evil spirit,
who, it is asserted by the Wogait, makes a big fire, from the
smoke of which he takes an infant and places it, at night, into
the womb of a lubra; and she must then give birth to the child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>In the same district, when it becomes known that a happy
event is pending, the husband goes out with his lubra and kills
a certain animal or collects certain vegetable products, which
he hands to the woman to eat, believing that these articles
when swallowed will ensure a successful birth.</p>

<p>To return to our story: Maiyarra was groaning with pains
in the abdomen. She was alone with the old woman Indarrakutta,
who was her mother-in-law, well beyond hearing distance
from the main camp. A small fire was burning sluggishly by
their side and throwing a thin column of bluish white smoke
into the air. Maiyarra was sitting upon a small patch of ground
cleared of the burrs, with her legs stretched before her. She
was propping her writhing body, sloping slightly backwards,
with her arms against the ground. The old woman sat closely
behind, with her arms thrown around Maiyarra’s waist, and
with her lower limbs, bent in the knee, enclosing and pressing
against the younger woman’s buttocks on either side. Occasionally
the old woman would relinquish her hold and make
for the fire, over which she warmed her hands to subsequently
massage the patient’s abdomen. Now and then she might even
rub warm ashes over it. Then the two sat in patient expectation,
and, whenever there came a pain, the old woman would
tighten her grip, while she spoke encouragingly to the parturient
Maiyarra. This method is very generally employed, except that
when the final stage has arrived, the Arunndta and other
neighbouring tribes in central Australia request the gin to squat
on her toes, with her buttocks resting over her heels.</p>

<p>The event is almost invariably spontaneous. In my experience
I have very rarely seen complications, and then usually when
the lubra has been living under civilized conditions.</p>

<p>Twins are very exceptionally seen; we do not mean to imply,
however, that multiple births do not occur more often than one
sees or hears of. No authentic observations are available to
satisfy our curiosity in regard to this point. We have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
repeatedly assured that when twins are born, one has arrived
as the result of the evil spirit’s witchcraft. The child, one is
informed, will do no good for itself, and, on account of the
evil within it, it will contaminate others with whom it comes
into contact, and, if it were allowed to grow up, it would be
in league with the evil spirit, whom it would look upon as a
brother, and to whom it would betray all the tribal secrets.
The evil spirit would carry this information to the enemy and
their tribe would surely be wiped out of existence. In consequence
of all this, the suspected one of the two infants is
destroyed, usually by one of the old women in attendance, who
places a red-hot coal in its mouth or smothers it with sand.</p>

<p>The placenta is waited for, and then the umbilical cord is
severed two or three inches from the child’s abdomen in one of
the following ways: It may be twisted off, cut with a sharp
fragment of shell or splinter of rock, or pinched off with the
finger-nails, or even bitten off with the teeth. Another method
is to batter it through with a stone, after which the small
remaining portion is packed with warm ashes. When it falls
off, it is tied around the child’s neck with a piece of fur-string,
where it is worn for a while as an amulet. The placenta is
either burned or buried.</p>

<p>Intentional interferences with pregnancy are rare among the
unsophisticated tribes, but rather frequent when the natives are
living under more civilized conditions. At Fowler’s Bay a gin,
who wishes to rid herself of prospective motherhood, collects
a number of black beetles, known as “<i>yarralyi</i>,” which she
roasts and reduces to powder. Of the powder she rubs some
into her armpits, and some over her breasts and pubes.</p>

medicinal values of herbs and surgical practices as one who is the recognized
sorcerer....”</p>

<p>(Note also the emu-feather skull cap, light-wood shield, and “<i>Kutturu</i>.”)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The newly-born infant, as it lies upon the sand, is rubbed all
over and dried with ashes; then it is usually transferred to a
sheet of bark or a trough-shaped bark food-carrier, in which it
is carried about during the first few months of its existence,
the mother, at feeding time and other odd moments, taking it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
up into her arms. On Sunday Island the bark food-carrier,
there known as “<i>oladda</i>,” is used as a cradle; one often might
see a busy mother, attending to duties which occupy her hands,
putting her child to sleep by simultaneously rocking the receptacle
containing it with her foot (<a href="#plate11">Plate XI</a>).</p>

<p>The Aluridja smear ochre, ashes, and fat over the body to
protect it against the hot wind and the flies. Some of the
south-eastern tribes, now practically extinct, did likewise.</p>

<p>Among the Kolaias near Cambridge Gulf the common practice
is to apply mother’s milk to the infant’s body and sprinkle
it with charcoal. In their endeavour to make a young mother’s
breast as productive as possible, the Aluridja and Arunndta
burn sticks of the mulga and stroke the breast with the charred
ends.</p>

<p>The Arunndta singe the infant’s hair with a fire-stick and
rub the skin over with charcoal to bring about a darkening of
the colour as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>In the same way as girl-piccaninnies are assigned to their
tribal husbands before even they are born, according to certain
group-relationships, so are the boys of the Port George IV
district apportioned by the same law to the old men, whom
they must obey, when called upon, throughout the term of the
elders’ lives.</p>

<p>An aboriginal gin is often charged with callousness towards
her offspring. Such an accusation, apart from proving the
informant’s ignorance, amounts to a slanderous injustice. The
aboriginal mother is as fondly attached to her babe as most
white women are to theirs, and the way she can endear herself
to it is pathetic. The men, too, exercise a chivalrous and
honourable guardianship over the innocents of their tribe as
well as over the children of any white settlers, who happen to
reside in their district. Those who have lived among the Australian
natives, like the northern squatters, know only too well
that under ordinary circumstances their children could not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
in safer custody than when entrusted to the care of the
aborigines.</p>

<p>An infant is never clothed. On Sunday Island a single
strand of human hair-string is tied around its hips and pubes.
Such is, of course, in the first place to decorate the body, and
secondly to charm away the evil-bringing spirits which may
surround it.</p>

<p>To bring warmth to an infant during the night, it is cuddled
by its mother or other near relative; during the day, when the
mother’s hands are otherwise occupied, a piccaninny is often
kept snug in its bark-cradle by bedding it upon, and sprinkling
it with, warm ashes.</p>

<p>A child is not weaned until it is at least three or four years
old; at times it is kept at the breast for even a year or more
longer. Nevertheless, a mixed diet is offered the suckling very
early in life; one often sees a baby, but a month or two old,
vigorously sucking the smooth head-end of a big bone and
apparently thoroughly enjoying the treat.</p>

<p>Different methods have been devised to assist the gins in
carrying their infants with as little inconvenience as possible
when on the march.</p>

<p>When the babe is very young, the bark-carrier is indispensable;
it is either carried under the arm or cleverly balanced
upon the head. In the latter case a circular cushion or ring-pad
is first placed on the head to steady the weight.</p>

<p>One precaution is constantly preached to young mothers,
namely, not to allow the child’s legs to hang over the edge of
the wooden carrier lest they grow crooked.</p>

<p>The tribes north of the Great Australian Bight swing the
infants in skins or plaited vegetable fibre mats over their backs,
the corners of the receptacles being tied in front of the mother’s
neck. The nearly extinct tribes of the lower River Murray
and surrounding districts, as far as western Victoria, used to
adopt the same method.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>When the child attains a riper age it sits in the bag-shaped
receptacle, its head being the only exposed part of its body
which is visible. The natives maintain that they originally
learned this dodge from the kangaroo, which carries its young
in a pouch.</p>

<p>When the child is a little older and has arrived at the
toddling stage, it is allowed to ride pick-a-back style upon its
mother’s back, where it secures its position by catching hold of
the gin’s shoulders, neck, or breasts. Another favourite method
is for the gin to straddle the child upon one of her hips and
hold it there with her arm.</p>

<p>Occasionally the child sits upon either parent’s shoulders and
hangs on to the elder’s head or hair. More for the excitement
created than as a recognized way of transport, the parent,
usually the father, may seat the child upon his head and hold
both his arms up for the rider to clasp. After a short run with
its father in this position, the child usually asks to be let down
again.</p>

<p>The most peculiar custom is that in vogue among the Wongapitcha
of the Tomkinson and other associated ranges in central
Australia. The child is laid across the small of the mother’s
back, face forwards, and is kept in a horizontal position by
partly lying upon the gin’s buttocks; it is supported by the
mother’s arms, one of which is held beneath its neck, the other
beneath its knees. By adopting this method of carrying, the gin
has both her hands free. The same method is adopted during
the transport of a favourite dog, the women maintaining that
it is a very comfortable occupation in the cold weather because
the animals help to keep them warm (<a href="#plate16">Plate XVI</a>, 1).</p>

<p>When off duty, that is when not on the tramp, hunting, or
wood-collecting, a gin will carry, rock, and caress her offspring
much like a European mother does, by tenderly clutching it in
both her arms.</p>

<p>If work permits, the mother often sits on the ground and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
lays her offspring across her lap; by lifting her thighs towards
her body, she forms a trough, in which the babe lies most
comfortably.</p>

<p>On the north coast one might occasionally see a gin swinging
her babe upon an aerial root or branch of a tree, or upon the
flexible stalk of a tropical climbing plant.</p>

<p>So soon as the child is able to walk and run, independently of
its mother, it is allowed every freedom, but never far away
from the watchful eye of its parent; quite occasionally, however,
one might meet with a toddler roaming about the bush all alone,
and miles away from the main camp. Recently we saw a little
chap near Running Waters on the Finke River, who would
wander away from camp and spend days alone in the sandhills.
The only nourishment he could find during his absence was a
handful of small bulbs, which grew along the sandy banks
of the Finke. It must be mentioned that this little fellow was
an orphan, and nobody seemed to take much notice of his
absence for the first day or so, after which a near relative
would set out, pick up the wanderer’s track, and bring him
back to camp.</p>

<p>Parents devote much of their time to the entertainment and
amusement of their children; but the economical side of play
is never forgotten. If during a game, a practical wrinkle can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
be taught, which will prove useful when the playful moments
are left behind and the more serious stage of life is entered, the
opportunity is never missed.</p>

<p>Much time is spent in the evenings teaching the younger
generation songs and dances, which allude to ancestral traits, to
the tricks of the chase, and to the damage the evil spirits can do.
The notes and calls of the different wild animals and birds,
with which the tribe has daily to do, are cleverly imitated and
explained, disregardless of the numerous repetitions, which are
begged, to satisfy the childish curiosity. For instance, the plover
is by the Western Arunndta called “<i>kurreke tata</i>,” which is
softly and musically rendered in imitation of the bird’s familiar
cry. The plover is described as a rain-maker, which is able to
bring the water from a cloud whenever it desires. Even the
European settler often refers to this bird as a “rainpiper”; the
connection between the species and rain no doubt having arisen
from the fact that plover usually follow up showers and remain
in the vicinity of any pools which collect upon the ground.
During any rain-making ceremonies the plover is frequently
mimicked. Another of their favourite items is the imitation of
a whining and howling dingo, which they accomplish with
wonderful accuracy.</p>

<p>The dances, too, are largely imitative. One of the most
popular of the Arunndta repertoire is the frog-dance. The child
adopts a sitting attitude and passes its arms from the outside,
behind the knees, and forwards to the ground. In this position,
it moves about on “all fours,” with a peculiar hopping motion,
adding greatly to the hilarity of the meeting.</p>

<p>Great pleasure is evinced by the beaming young faces when
an adult prepares to draw pictures in the sand. A small circular
patch of ground is cleared by the entertainer, and the children
seat themselves around it. Having smoothed the surface with
the palm of his hand, he proceeds to “draw” by scratching the
design into the sand with a small pointed stick. Although the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
pictures are crude, and often nothing short of puzzles to the
European, the artist talks all the while to the children in such
a convincing way that, even assuming their eye incapable of
comprehension, their interest is excited or persuaded to such an
extent as to almost render the few lines in the sand a living
reality. “Here is the man,” explains the artist, as he draws a
vertical line, “walking about” (a number of small holes are
tapped into the sand), “he sees a lizard” (a longer line on a
slope crossed by two shorter bars at right angles), “away it
runs” (pairs of taps slantingly opposite to each other), “the
man after it” (single taps between the former pairs), “he throws
a boomerang” (the familiar shape of the weapon is outlined),
“the lizard goes down a hole” (a hole is scratched into the
ground), “the Kurdaitcha take it, it is gone!” (he slaps the
spot with the flat of his hand). “<i>Yerrai!</i> What is that? A
snake!” (emerging from the hole he draws a curved line), “the
man has lost his boomerang but he hits the snake with his
waddy” (the curved line is smacked several times with the
small drawing stick the artist holds in his hand). “<i>I, i, i!</i>
he has finished (<i>i.e.</i> killed) it.” And so the narration might go
on for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Commendable pains are taken by the adults in imitating the
tracks of all the animals of chase, and the children are invited
to compete in reproducing them. For instance, an “emu track”
is obtained by pressing the inner surfaces of the index finger
and thumb, held at an angle of about forty-five degrees, into a
smooth patch of sand; then, without lifting the index finger, the
thumb is moved to the opposite side and there pressed into the
sand, at about the same angle as before. Often the impression
of the “pad” of the bird’s foot is indicated by dabbing the round
point of the thumb into the sand immediately behind the intersection
of the three “toes.”</p>

<p>A kangaroo track is simple, and is made by imprinting a
finger or big toe twice in the sand, an inch or two apart, so that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the resulting marks are two parallel grooves supposed to represent
the impressions of the long central toes of the marsupial.
A shorter mark is made at the centre of either of these, at an
angle of about forty-five degrees, to indicate the lateral toes,
when the track is complete. At times a small scratch or hole
is made at the end of each of the “toes,” to suggest the claw-marks.</p>

<p>A dog track is made with the fingers alone. The tip of the
thumb makes an imprint, which is to represent the pad, whilst
the finger-tips supply those of the four toes, ranged in a semi-circle
about the former. The claw-marks are added in the
same way as described of the kangaroo track.</p>

<p>A human track is imitated by imprinting the outer edge of a
half-closed hand, the left hand being used for the left foot and
the right for the right. This impression will give the ball, the
outer surface, and the heel of the required track; the toe-marks
are dabbed in with the finger-tips.</p>

<p>Where the camel is known, its track is reproduced. A piccaninny
is momentarily sat upon a smooth patch of sand and
lifted away again; the imprint of its stern supplies the outline
for the required track. The lower half of ridge left in the
sand by the cleft between the child’s buttocks is obliterated,
when the “track” is ready for the never-failing applause. Occasionally
the upper angles, representing the camel’s toes, are
improved by making them more acute and deepening them to
show where the claws are supposed to have cut into the ground.</p>

<p>The study of animal-spoors in all their specific and various
intricacies, and especially the art of individualizing the human
foot-print, rank among the most important and earliest occupations
of the aboriginal child’s mind. Parents are required by
law to see that the children receive constant instruction and
exercise in this department. It is a common thing for a mother
to purposely slip away from her child and not to respond to the
imploring wail, which follows when her absence is discovered.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
The only sympathy some relatives or friends might proffer is to
direct the child’s notice to its mother’s tracks and at the same
time urging it to follow them up.</p>

<p>Whereas the average European can distinguish between the
tracks of a dog and a cat, it is a decidedly more difficult matter
for him to discriminate between those of a mastiff and a wolf
on the one hand and, say, those of a sheep-dog and a fox or
jackal on the other. The aboriginal, however, learns to recognize
not only the class, or species, or variety, as they are
known to us, by the spoors, but can particularize each single
individual. By looking at a track, for instance, which we can
only describe as a “dog track,” an aboriginal can immediately
tell us whether it is that of a “wild-dog” or of a “whitefellow-dog,”
whether the animal is young or old, male or female, and
whether it passed over the ground sometime to-day, yesterday,
the day before, or a week ago; finally, he will tell us whether
he has ever seen the dog, and, if so, he will probably know who
the owner is. And all this information comes at a glance!</p>

<p>The children love basking in the sand; and spend hours
playing with the glistening white and red drifts so plentiful in
central and northern Australia. Little mounds are built, upon
which they sit to defy the others to topple them; and oblong
holes are scratched, into which some of the younger are laid and
almost completely covered with sand. When the buried ones
presently throw the sand from their bodies, the rest of the
players scamper off with a hullabaloo and tell their elders the
Kurdaitcha (devil-devil) is coming.</p>

<p>Along the north coast of Australia, the mud-banks of the
tidal rivers are a great source of amusement. When the water
recedes during the heat of day, the young folk make for the
blue mud-banks to indulge in sport and play. Mud-sliding is
usually the first item of the programme. Taking a long run
over the firmer ground, the performers reach the mud-bank
with considerable velocity, and in consequence of this, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
slide over the slimy surface in much the same style as our
children in the Old Country do over the ice. They maintain
their balance with their arms. The sliding is effected either
singly or in long chains they form by joining hands. They
endeavour to make their slide reach the water, which, if they are
successful, they enter with no end of splashing and shrieking
“<i>Ai! Ai! Ai!</i>”</p>

<p>Another method often tried is to run and then take the
“slide” lying upon chest and belly. As one is sliding this way,
he turns his body round its long axis and eventually disappears
into the water. To the observer a child sliding in this way
looks deceptively like a stranded dugong or other big fish endeavouring
to make back to water. Occasionally one of the
sporters breaks the monotony of the game by negotiating the
“slide” with his stern. Or he may bring along a small oblong
sheet of bark, upon which he sits or kneels and propels himself
along with his foot. In modern language this toy might be
called a “mud-scooter.”</p>

<p>On Cambridge Gulf the girls have evolved yet another
variety of this sport. One lies flat on the mud, face downward,
whilst another stands behind her. The one lying now places
her arms forwards and holds the palms of her hands together;
at the same time she bends her legs to a rectangle in the knees,
and keeping them together she holds them rigid in that position.
Now the girl standing behind seizes the legs of the one on the
mud at about the ankles and pushes the human sleigh along the
“slide.” As a special favour a piccaninny might be allowed to
take a seat upon the sliding girl’s back.</p>

<p>In the same district the boys delight in carrying each other
pick-a-back to the brink of the softest mud, to precipitate the
rider backwards into the slush or into the water.</p>

<p>To break the monotony, the children place themselves in a
row, each with a number of flattish pebbles previously collected
on the dry land, and take it turn about to pelt the surface of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the water at a very sharp angle in order to make the stone
ricochet as many times as possible.</p>

<p>A new game is begun by the girls stamping the water with
their feet, as at a corroboree; the boys are preparing for a
sham-fight. They cover the whole of their body, including the
hair, with thick mud, which they maintain is the same as the
ochre the warriors apply to their bodies when on the war-path.
They pick sides and stand face to face on a bank, about half a
chain apart. Upon a given signal they commence bombarding
each other with mud-balls! One is reminded of the snowballing
feats of European school children. The lads endeavour
to dodge the mud-balls thrown by their adversaries with as little
movement as possible, by just contorting the figure or lifting a
limb to allow a missile to fly harmlessly by. Much gesticulation
takes place during the friendly combat, and often does one
hear an excited “<i>Ai! Ai!</i>” announcing the fact that a player
has effected a narrow escape. The climax, however, is not
reached until a hit is recorded, and a ball, too carefully aimed,
spatters the body of a neglectful opponent. When the game is
over, all participants rest for a while upon the surface of the
muddy bank, then dive into the water and wash the slush from
their heated bodies.</p>

<p>At Kurrekapinnya Soakage in the Ayers Ranges the bare,
inclined surface of a granitic outcrop is utilized by the children
for tobogganing. The same track has been in use for so long
that the “slide” has become remarkably smooth from the constant
wear. The tobogganer gathers a bundle of rushes at the
soakage and makes for the top of the outcrop. There he places
the bundle upon the polished “slide,” sits upon it, and starts
himself moving down the slope. Considerable speed is attained
by the time he reaches the bottom of the rock, whence he shoots
into the sand adjacent to it. The performance is repeated over
and over again.</p>

<p>The Victoria River tribes arrange competitions among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
boys in tree-climbing, the lads being required to clamber up a
number of selected trees, and down again, in the quickest time
possible.</p>

<p>On Bathurst Island a favourite amusement of the younger
folk on a breezy day is to collect the light globular seed-heads
of the “spring rolling grass” (<i>Spinifex hirsutis</i>), that grow on
every sandhill near the coast, and take them to the beach to
release them on the hardened sand. Driven along by the wind,
these seeds travel over the surface at no mean pace. Allowing
them to gain a fair start, the children bolt after them, endeavouring
to overtake them and pick them up from the ground
while dashing past at full speed in “cow-boy” fashion.</p>

<p>In the same locality the children assemble on the beach and
compete in running and long jumping.</p>

<p>The Arunndta and Dieri children collect the dry tussocks of
the “roly poly” (<i>Salsola kali</i>) upon a windy day and take
them to a big clay pan. There they liberate them, and, as the
wind whips them over the level ground, the youthful gang
makes after them with toy spear or boomerang, each endeavouring
to either stake a tussock with the first-named weapon
or shatter it with the latter.</p>

<p>In the Fowler’s Bay district the tussock is replaced by an
artificial target, such as a ball of fur-string, which is rolled
over the surface by an elder.</p>

<p>The Arunndta boys on the Finke River cut discs out of the
bark of eucalyptus trees, which they roll over the hard ground
and chase with toy spears. In the same district I have seen
the bark disc replaced by an iron ring the boys had been given
by a teamster; this was carefully kept in one of the huts and
only produced when the lads were at liberty and felt inclined
“to tilt at the ring.”</p>

</figure>

<p>A modification of the game was observed in the Humbert
River district, Northern Territory. Two parties, of about half-a-dozen
each in number, take up positions opposite each other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
and about a chain or chain and a half apart. A circular piece
of thick green bark is thrown overarm by a member of one
party swiftly towards the other, so that it strikes the ground a
little distance in front of the latter and rolls along the ground
past them. The waiting party stand in a row, with their spears
poised, and each in succession rushes forward to pierce the
rolling disc by hurling his missile at it. If one is successful the
fact is immediately announced by loud cheering. Then one of
the party, who have thrown, returns the disc in a similar way
to the opposite side whilst several of his fellows collect the
spears for the next turn. Thus the players are alternately
“active” and “passive.” Special short wooden spears are used,
about five feet long, pointed at one end. The disc is shaped
out of an irregular piece of bark by biting off the angular points
until a more or less circular piece is obtained. Men and youths
play for hours at a time at this game, which they call “<i>gorri</i>”;
and even children are tolerated by them, although the last-named
are often growled at and told to keep out of the way
(<a href="#plate13">Plate XIII</a>, 1).</p>

<p>A kind of hand-ball is practised on Bathurst Island. The
seeds of the Zamia (<i>Cycas media</i>) take the place of a small ball.
Two lads stand facing each other and hit the seed to and fro
with the palms of their hands, after the style of a modern game
of tennis. On the Victoria River, the children made similar use
of the green seed capsules of the cotton-tree.</p>

<p>In the Meda district of north-western Australia, players at
the same game employed flat pieces of wood resembling cricket
bats, the balls being fashioned out of the woody fruits of the
Pandanus.</p>

<p>Catch-ball is played by the children of all Australian tribes.
The “balls” might consist of anything; the Arunndta of the
Finke River country use the seeds of the <i>Macrozamia Macdonnelli</i>,
the natives of Melville and Bathurst Island Zamia and
Pandanus seeds, the Larrekiya of Port Darwin small bags<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
stuffed with fur, the scrotum of a kangaroo being often used
for the purpose. It is surprising, however, that despite the
quickness of their eyes and the keenness of their sight, the
natives, as a rule, are very backward at catching with their
hands any object which is thrown at them.</p>

<p>The boys of the Arunndta and Aluridja tribes construct a
small cylindrical stick sharpened at both ends, which they lay
on the ground; then, with a longer stick held in the right hand,
they strike one end of it, to make it bounce into the air, and,
as it rises, hit it with considerable force. Competitions are held
to see who can, by this method, drive the small object farthest.
The game is much the same as our familiar “tip-cat.”</p>

<p>From Sunday Island I have already recorded a peculiar type
of throwing contest, which the girls were indulging in at the
time of our visit. Two rows of seven or eight each were
standing a couple of chains apart, and, whilst facing one another,
were bombarding their opponents with consolidated cakes
of cow-dung. The missiles were thrown with considerable skill,
even by the smallest girls, due allowance being made for the
curvature in flight. It was part of the game to dodge the flying
bodies, and, whenever a hit was recorded, a triumphant cheer
would ring from the opposite side. In rushing wildly about
the space, the light calico skirts of the playing damsels would
fly high in the air, exposing their slender limbs beneath. In
their eagerness to hit, and avoid being hit, they repeatedly exclaimed:
“<i>Arre minya, arre minya</i>.” Some of the more experienced
throwers showed their proficiency by using flat slabs
of stone in lieu of the cakes of dung.</p>

<p>The games we generally refer to as “hide-and-seek” are
known to the tribes of Australia. In one game a number of
persons hide behind bushes and boulders and are sought by one
or more children; in another an article is hidden by one and
looked for by the rest of the party. The players endeavour to
mislead the “seeker” by obliterating their tracks and substituting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
them by all sorts of “back-to-front,” “devil-devil,” and other
deceptive tracks. When a “find” is made there is a loud,
jubilant cry; and the “hider,” unless he can escape in time, is
pommelled by the “seeker”; the players do not, however, run
back to a crease or “home,” as we do in the European game.</p>

<p>Once one considers toys supplied by adults for the special
benefit of children, the question resolves itself into an analysis
of endless possibilities of creation achieved by the happy combination
of inventive mimicry and lucid interpretation. It would
be as futile to attempt an exhaustive discussion upon so big a
subject as it would be to even try to describe all the artificial
objects one classes as toys, however crude they might appear,
which are manufactured for the purpose of entertaining and
instructing the child. And, indeed, the young folks themselves
are neither idle nor behindhand in augmenting the collection of
playthings supplied by others.</p>

<p>Most of these articles are, however, made on the spur of an
impulse and serve their purpose just for the time being.</p>

<p>One of the favourite occupations of the children of all Australian
tribes is to build small brushwood shelters and wurlies
for themselves to sit and talk in like grown-ups. Occasionally
they occupy these miniature domiciles as “father and mother,”
but more often as “father” or “mother,” with a number of
“children” to “look after.”</p>

<p>When the “children” are not available as living playmates,
inanimate objects, such as stone, bits of wood, leaves and flowers,
are selected to take the “children’s” place. These receive names
and are placed in a row before the “foster parent,” who talks
to them and frequently changes them about. But the best part
of the game is when one of the “children” is supposed to misbehave
itself, and in consequence must receive a good flogging
with a stick, kept handy for that purpose. At other times one
of the objects is taken up, nursed, and spoken to most affectionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>Here then we have the idea of the doll, simple though it be.
But after all, simplicity in method, so far as the training of
children is concerned, is perhaps the readiest means of stimulating
the imitative, and with it the creative, force which Nature
has endowed them with.</p>

<p>The doll is usually just a plain stick or stone, with perhaps
some distinguishing feature upon it, like a knob at one end
which represents the head. Occasionally it is painted with red
ochre. Dr. W. E. Roth found that on the Tully River in
Queensland a forked stick is chosen so as to permit the child
fixing it on its neck like a mother carrying her baby, with its
lower limbs dangling over the shoulders.</p>

<p>Imaginary fireless cooking is also a pastime the little girls
never tire of. A shallow hole is scooped, into which a few
handfuls of cold ashes are thrown; this represents the fireplace.
Upon the ashes is laid a pebble, a leaf, or any other article
which they make up their minds to “cook.” Having covered it
with sand in the orthodox way, the girls sit and talk, whilst
they make themselves believe the dish is in course of preparation.
They invite each other to the prospective feast, each explaining
what she is cooking; one might have a wallaby, another a lizard,
and still another a yam.</p>

<p>Quite apart from accompanying their mothers on the regular
hunting expeditions, the little boys often go out alone. They
carry toy weapons, with which they say they are going to slay
a kangaroo or anything else happening to come their way. In
the Fitzroy River district the young hunters collect, or cut out
of a gum-tree butt, several pieces of bark, dry or fresh, and shy
these into the crown of a boabab (<i>Brachychiton Gregorii</i>),
hoping to fell a nut or two. If they are successful, they proudly
return to camp with their spoil and obtain permission to roast
it at the fireside. The small bark missiles are looked upon by
the boys as quite equivalent to the “<i>kaili</i>” (boomerangs) of their
fathers; and there is no doubt they can throw them with greater<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
skill. I have seen the little fellows stalk a flock of foraging
cockatoo and, when within range, fling several of the toy
weapons into the birds as they are rising; invariably one or two
birds are brought to fall.</p>

<p>Rocking a child to sleep.</p>

<p>“On Sunday Island the bark food-carrier, there known as “oladda,” is
used as a cradle; one might often see a busy mother, attending to duties
which occupy her hands, putting her child to sleep by simultaneously
rocking the receptacle containing it with her foot.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The trimmed stalks of bullrushes and reeds make excellent
toy spears, which are thrown with the heavier end pointing
forwards and the thinner end poised against the index finger of
the right hand. With these “weapons” the lads have both mock
fights and mock hunts. In the latter case, one or two of their
number act the part of either a hopping kangaroo or a strutting
emu and, by clever movements of the body, endeavour to evade
the weapons of the hunting gang.</p>

<p>One of the favourite pastimes of young and old among the
Kukata is to play at “emu.” The players take a stick, about
three feet long, and tie a bundle of grass, brushwood, or feathers
to one end of it, to represent the neck and the head. The
performer clasps this stick with both hands and holds it erect
in front of him; then he bends his body forwards from the hips,
whilst other persons cover him with skins, and tie a tussock of
grass over his stern to indicate the tail. The actor next begins
to walk around, as truly as possible imitating the actions of the
bird he is representing. As he walks, he nods his “head,”
while some of the children scamper round him in great excitement,
others flee from him shrieking with terror. After a while
he stops short, turns his head and shakes his body, finally
running away in a zig-zag course. As he runs, he frequently
imitates the peculiar deep note of the old emu and occasionally
the shrill whistling cry of the young. A most amusing little incident,
which I saw in connection with this game, happened near
Mount Eba. A man, fully rigged as an emu, was entertaining
the camp with some very clever, bird-like antics, when suddenly
a vicious mongrel darted at the performer from a wurlie he was
passing. The “emu,” without any deliberation at all, dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
its head, scampered across the ground, hotly pursued by the
dog, and, in its terror, climbed the nearest tree.</p>

<p>The King Sound men construct miniature “<i>kaili</i>,” barely an
inch in length, and practically straight, which they project,
before the admiring eyes of their juvenile audience, by using
their fingers only. The little toy is held between the second
and third phalanges of the left index finger, so that a good half
of its length projects above the hand. The inner tip of the
right index finger is pressed strongly against the outer surface
of the left thumb and suddenly allowed to slip over the top
edge and strike the projecting part of the toy. The little slab
of wood is jerked into the air, whirls through space in a parabolic
curve, and, when well managed, returns to the hand of
the projector. The children often try this feat, but, with the
exception of a rare fluke, never succeed; in fact, it is not every
adult man who can do it.</p>

<p>On Sunday Island, small models of the raft (“<i>kaloa</i>”),
locally used, are made for the children to play with. These
toys are exact replicas of the craft described in a subsequent
chapter and are neatly constructed in every detail.</p>

<p>A kind of dart is made by the children in the Northern
Kimberleys of Western Australia out of the root ends of grass
seed-stalks, six to eight inches long. These are held, one at a
time, between the palms of the hands parallel to, and between,
the middle fingers, beyond which they project but a fraction of
an inch. In this position the hands are turned so that the fingers
point towards the body. Then taking careful aim at an object,
the child throws its hands vigorously forwards, at the same
instant opening them and shooting the dart in the desired
direction.</p>

<p>Among the Dieri, Yantowannta, and Ngameni, principally,
and to a less extent among the Arunndta, Aluridja, and Kukata,
a playing stick is found which is commonly known by the name
of “<i>kukerra</i>.” Although a toy, the men only were observed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
to use it, not only to amuse the children, but for the benefit of
the whole camp. The kukerra is a slender, club-shaped stick
made out of the Mulga. Its length is about three feet six inches,
of which the thickened end occupies something like nine inches;
the head, <i>i.e.</i> the swollen portion, is up to an inch or slightly
more in diameter, whilst the “stick” is not thicker than an
ordinary lead pencil; each end terminates in a blunt point. The
Dieri kukerras are lighter and more slender than the Arunndta
or Aluridja. The playing stick is seized at its thin end and,
swinging it with a straight arm, it is made to strike a bush or
tussock in front of the thrower; whence it bounds through the
air in an inclined position, and, after striking the ground, glides
along the surface in a snake-like manner.</p>

<p>Natives are fond of spinning any suitable objects which fall
into their hands; small pebbles, gall-nuts, and the larger varieties
of conical and bell-shaped eucalyptus fruits are all made to spin
upon a level surface just to amuse the children. The Yantowannta,
Wongkanguru, and other tribes of the Cooper Creek
region are very clever at moulding tops out of clay, with real
pegs, upon which the toys revolve. These tops are undoubtedly
an indigenous invention. The spinning is usually accomplished
by rubbing the toy between the palms of both hands.</p>

<p>Skipping is indulged in by little boys and girls alike. A long
vine is used by the Wogaits on the Daly River, which is swung
to and fro like a pendulum by two of the players, whilst others
jump over the line as it passes beneath them. The “rope” is
not swung overhead.</p>

<p>At Engoordina, Arunndta children and women were noticed
to entertain the tribe by artful tricks with an endless piece of
string. By an intricate method of inter-looping and threading,
a long cord, tied together at its ends, so as to form a complete
ring, is transformed into different patterns of squares, triangles,
and circles, the composite groups of which are intended to
represent different natural objects. The string is held at different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
points, according to the complexity of the design, by the
fingers, toes, and mouth of the performer; occasionally, indeed,
the services of an assistant are required to support the pattern
whilst it is being constructed. The more elaborate articles
when completed resemble a loosely netted or knitted fabric, the
plainer are more after the style of a few loops or meshes lightly
held together. Some of the designs bear a recognizable resemblance
to the objects they are intended to represent (<i>e.g.</i> birds,
animals, men, etc.), others appear to be (to the European at
any rate) rather far-fetched. Very often a complicated-looking
design can be instantly reduced to the original piece of string
by simply pulling one of its component loops or ends.</p>

<p>Dr. W. E. Roth has very ably described a series of such
figures, made with one or two endless strings, which he found
to be commonly constructed throughout north Queensland,
where the tribes play a game resembling the European “cratch-cradle.”</p>

<p>Children are not allowed to attend many tribal ceremonies;
consequently one does not often see them with their bodies
decorated or ornamented. There are occasions, however, when
their presence is tolerated, such as, for instance, at receptions
to relatives who are returning from a fight or long hunting
expedition. White earth or kaolin is invariably used for beautifying
the appearance, it being maintained that it is unwise to
apply much red, the token of blood, to the body of one who
has not sacrificed some of his blood during the course of such
ceremonies as will elevate him to the status of the tribe’s manhood.
The kaolin is applied in the form of a thick paste in a
series of thin lines. On Sunday Island these lines pass from
the centre of the shoulder, on either side, diagonally to and
along the breast-bone; and horizontally across the thighs and
forearms. The face has a smear of white straight down the
nose, and two semi-circular lines, which enclose the mouth and
converge to a point opposite the ear on either side. The child<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
in addition wears a belt of twisted human hair-string, from
which pends a pearl shell ornament; it might also carry a plume
of white cockatoo feathers in its hair. There are slight variations
in the patterns and designs chosen for child-decoration
both in the same tribal group and among different tribes, but
no matter what part of Australia is considered, the effect completed
is decidedly less elaborate than the complex and ornate
colour schemes seen in the ceremonial displays of performing
men. The children take no active part in such proceedings,
but usually walk or stand about at points where they do not
interfere with the proceedings in general. There is no objection
to the child carrying one of the boomerangs of its father, but
under no conditions is it permitted to handle a spear-thrower.</p>

<p>Children are early accustomed to discipline and obedience.
They are not required to obey any but their individual fathers,
tribal fathers, and tribal uncles. They need not pay heed to
the orders of their contemporaries, but only to the word of
such as they consider “grew them,” that is, men of a previous
generation to themselves. Women need not be obeyed by law,
but, with the knowledge and sanction of a father, a mother can
chastise and punish a child as much as she pleases. The father
reserves the right to interfere at any moment.</p>

<p>The little girls accompany their mothers whenever collecting
rambles are undertaken. They receive instructions in the
methods of locating and gathering grubs, lizards, seeds, and
roots; and during this time they are required to daily handle
the yam-stick in the correct manner as shown them by their
seniors. Subsequently they are taught how to clean, cook, and
prepare the meals to be placed before the men.</p>

<p>The boys are early in life schooled in the practices of carpentry,
so far as they are applied to the making and shaping of
domestic utensils and weapons with the few crude implements
at their disposal.</p>

<p>Further, they are instructed in the knacks and arts of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
handling and throwing weapons of chase, attack, and defence.
The lads take to this instruction enthusiastically. For instance,
whilst being taught the art of boomerang-throwing, one might
daily see a youngster, even in the absence of his master, posing
in the attitude demonstrated to him, without actually letting
the piece of wood, which answers the purpose of a weapon, go
out of his hand (<a href="#plate14">Plate XIV</a>, 1).</p>

<p>Boys are not allowed to handle real boomerangs, spears, or
shields before they have undergone the first initiation ceremony.
If they did so, the offence would be looked upon as an insult
to the dignity of the men who have qualified and are thus
entitled to the privilege of carrying such weapons on parade.
The offence is in fact, on a point of decorum, similar to the
case of a fellow in the “rank and file” wearing the sword or
insignia of his superior officer.</p>

<p>When, at a later stage, the elder boys of the Northern Kimberleys
of Western Australia become well-skilled in throwing,
sham-fights are arranged. Pieces of bark are broken from the
mangroves, out of which the combatants make missiles resembling
straight boomerangs. Sides are picked under the
supervision of the men and the signal given to start. In a
moment the air becomes alive with the whirr and buzz of the
flying pieces of wood, which the youths throw straight at one
another. Often severe gashes and wounds are inflicted upon
the bodies of the “fighters,” but such are taken in good faith
and looked upon as being part of the game.</p>

<p>As a means of self-defence and protection against such
throwing-sticks and the small toy-spears previously mentioned,
the Arunndta construct for their boys light bark shields. A
piece of green bark is cut out of the butt of a eucalyptus,
oblong-oval in shape and about two feet long and six inches
wide. Two holes are cut in the central line of this piece, about
six inches from either end, and through them two or three
fairly stout, green twigs are stuck, from the under, concave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
surface, to form a handle. The points of these twigs stick out
from the top surface, some two inches, but they are left to
prevent the ends of the handle from slipping out. The bark
is then bent in the required shield-shape and dried over a slow
fire or in hot ashes (<a href="#plate14">Plate XIV</a>, 1).</p>

<p>The girls, too, are encouraged to indulge in stick-practice to
prepare them for the “<i>kutturu</i>” duels they will have to take
part in, in later years. The principal mark is the foot, which
each alternately tries to strike, while the other is “on guard”
with her stick. At other times they stand face to face, with the
palms of their hands pressed tightly together. Presently one
voluntarily bows her head, when the other immediately gives
her a severe crack over the scalp with the small finger side of
her hands. Then the other has a turn; and the process may
be repeated. The object of this strange procedure is to “harden”
the head in anticipation of the real blows it will receive in time
to come. To make the performance appear genuine, the girl,
whose turn it is to strike, may be heard to feign a curse:
“<i>Atutnia, arrelinjerrai!</i>”</p>

<p>The child’s mind is early imbued with the importance of
hardening the body and nerve against pain, and thereby making
the system less susceptible to the hardships of life, which they
know to be inevitable.</p>

<p>The system of personal mutilation, described in a subsequent
chapter, has to a certain extent been evolved for a similar reason.</p>

<p>Camp life brings many little accidents with it, but the
Spartan principles which are cultivated lead to an almost complete
ignorance of the existence of pain as might be brought
about by small cuts or burns. Just for the sake of competitive
amusement, the boys of the Kukata tribe take a live coal from
the fire and lay it upon the naked skin of their forearm. A
red-hot coal, about the size of a pea, is usually selected for the
purpose and momentarily “cooled” or “blackened” by covering
it with a handful of sand. The black coal is then placed upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the forearm at any suitable spot and touched with the red-hot
point of a firestick. The coal on the arm immediately turns
red again and in that condition is allowed to remain there until
it falls to white ash. The first effect is naturally to raise a
blister, but this is soon burnt through and the raw skin is
exposed, upon which the coal gently fizzles. Whilst this is
going on, the boy is seen to bite his lips together and to clinch
the fist of the suffering arm, as if to suppress the pain. The
lesion will, of course, leave a permanent scar. Some of the lads
have many of such marks upon both arms, and they seem quite
proud of them.</p>

<p>In the camps of any of the tribal groups throughout Australia,
who are still enjoying an uncontaminated life, one might
see captive birds and animals temporarily tethered or kept for
the amusement of children. Such are usually brought home by
the men returning from their hunting expeditions. A young
wallaby, for instance, is let go on an open flat and all the
children set after it. They are not allowed to hurl stones or
sticks after the fleeing game, but must retake it alive by the
use of their hands only. Although it is against the rules to
harm a captured animal, it is a curious circumstance that a
native, even if grown up, invariably forgets to feed it, although
entertaining the idea of keeping it alive. Occasionally, however,
it happens that a creature survives and looks after its own
needs; in this case the animal or bird becomes a real pet and is
not made the object of children’s coursing matches any more.</p>

<p>The King Sound natives catch the small ring-tailed opossums,
which live in the mangroves, and hand them to their children.
The Ponga-Ponga gins become very attached to these marsupial
pets, which they carry about with them on their days’ outings
planted in the locks of their hair. The opossums seem quite
contented to abide there whilst their mistresses are on the march
and hang on by means of their claws and tail (<a href="#plate10">Plate X</a>, 2).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Occasionally one might even see an affectionate gin suckling
her pet at her breast.</p>

<p>On Sunday Island several cockatoos were kept by a fishing
party in their camp not far from shore. The birds had their
flight feathers pulled and were allowed to roam about the
country in search of food. The cockatoos seemed to regard the
huts as their home, to which they invariably returned; they had,
moreover, picked up many phrases of the aboriginal tongue.</p>

<p>Although the native animals and birds of Australia have
always been, and still are, the daily object of aboriginal chase,
it is a remarkable fact that great friendships are made between
the hunter and his would-be prey when the latter is in captivity.
Indeed, the instinctive fear of an animal or bird is ever so much
greater when a white man approaches than when a native does.
I have seen cases where semi-wild cockatoos, magpies, and other
birds have allowed themselves to be handled by natives without
much concern, but the moment a European attempted to do
likewise, the bird would become unmanageable, terrified, and
vicious. Partly domesticated birds seem to have a predilection
for perching themselves upon the legs of their native masters
when the latter are sitting or lying on the ground. Talking of
instinct reminds me of the occasions I took aborigines to the
Zoological Gardens to see the favourite attraction, viz. the
“monkey-wurlie.” Whilst European visitors were coming and
going, the apes would appear unconcerned, phlegmatic, and
blasé; but the moment the dark-skinned people arrived, the
animals would instantly become electrified and bounce towards
the iron bars, which they seized and shook frantically. The
natives, on the other hand, would evince no fear, but endeavoured
to edge as close as possible to the monkeys, although
they had never seen one before. The monkeys, in appreciation
of the coloured visitors’ benignity, would grin, wink their eyes,
and make guttural noises.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit to the Forrest River Mission Station,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
a tethered monkey was kept on the premises. The natives
regarded it as a real “little man,” and many of them, especially
the children, were on excellent terms with it, but this could
not be said of some of the old men. The monkey and the
children were inseparable, and usually at play; but occasionally
disputes arose which always ended in an open tussle, during
which hands, teeth, and finger-nails were used. Although young
humanity did not always fare best, the monkey would never
take a mean advantage nor resort to extreme tactics. When it
found itself victorious, it would jump triumphantly on to its
perch and cry “<i>Arre Arre</i>.”</p>

<p>Orders of the day—Selection of camp site—Feminine water carriers—Great

<p>“When another sun will come, and when he is still a piccaninny,
Punya umberri (everybody) will walk to the big stone
(hill), lying in the gum-trees, where Kuddoguddogu (a landmark)
holds up the clouds of the Pindanol’s country. Narrawiddi
and Wetninnya will carry my angamma (bark-wrap with
small personal belongings), and all other women will take
many naramarragam (bark food-carriers) and fill them with
yams on the way. Plenty water sits upon the ground. The
men will run the kangaroo’s track with me.”</p>

<p>Upon an order like this from one of the old men, the following
day’s itinerary is cast. Brief though it seems, it is
sufficient because, although the chances of the coming expedition
might widely separate the members of the group, they keep
in constant touch with each other by signs and signals best
known to themselves.</p>

<p>The site for a camping ground is thus always selected by one
of the old men in authority. Preference is given, other things
being equal, to a spot near to a natural water supply. There
are, of course, numerous occasions when there is no water
available. When, for instance, the natives are hunting in the
sandhills during a good season, they either carry water with
them for miles, or rely on the succulent parakylia and other
water-holding plants.</p>

<p>It falls to the lot of the women to carry water upon such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
occasions. The fluid is contained in bark carriers of different
designs, which they either skilfully balance upon their heads or
carry under their arms. The water is kept from splashing over
the sides, in the first place by the naturally graceful gait of the
women; but, at the same time, an intentional addition of twigs
and branchlets further checks any undue movement of the fluid
which might be produced in the vessel during the march.</p>

<p>The Dieri, Yantowannta, Ngameni, Arunndta, Aluridja,
Wongapitcha, and other central Australian tribes use shield or
trough-shaped carriers cut out of the bark of the eucalyptus,
shaped and hardened over the fire. The shield type is flat,
with more or less open ends; the trough type has higher sides
and ends, and is therefore more capacious. There is, however,
no hard and fast division between the two. The surfaces of
these are either smooth or longitudinally grooved with a stone
scraper. The largest were observed on Cooper’s Creek,
measuring three feet in length, one foot in width, and five
inches in depth, while those of the Arunndta and Aluridja are
not quite so long and wide, but they may be deeper. The
utensils go by different names, according to tribe and locality;
three of the most commonly heard are “<i>mika</i>,” “<i>pitchi</i>,” and
“<i>cooleman</i>.” In addition to taking the place of water-holders,
they are also used as food-carriers.</p>

<p>North of the MacDonnell Ranges, similar articles are cut
out of solid wood, usually the Northern Territory Beantree
(<i>Erythrina vespertilio</i>).</p>

<p>The Warramunga and Kaitish (or Kaitidji) tribes in addition
make large canoe-shaped carriers out of similar material.
Two varieties are met with. The first is more or less flat-bottomed
with steeply inclined sides coming to a sharp edge at
each end; the second is uniformly curved, shield-like, with all
its sides standing at about the same level at the open end. The
former is grooved longitudinally on the outside surface only,
the inside being left in the rough; the latter is finely grooved on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the inner, as well as the outer surfaces. Both types are generally
painted over with red ochre. It is a decidedly laborious job to
remove the wood, which originally fills the inside of this carrier,
a fact which will be realized when one considers that it has
all to be done by burning with live coals, and gouging and
scraping with stone implements.</p>

<p>The Sunday Islanders take a rectangular sheet of bark of
the woolly-butt eucalyptus, fold both ends for a distance of
three or four inches, into pleats (like a concertina), and stitch
them together with split cane. The utensil is used throughout
the north-west coast as far as Cambridge Gulf.</p>

<p>On Bathurst and Melville Islands similar structures are made
out of the bark of the paper-bark tree (<i>Melaleuca</i>). An oblong
piece is bent upon itself lengthwise, both its ends folded, as in
the previous case, and kept together by binding with cane or
by spiking with short wooden pegs.</p>

<p>The same pattern, slightly modified here and there, is found
along the shores and islands of the Gulf of Carpentaria and the
Cape York Peninsula. We might say, therefore, that it occurs
throughout the entire length of the north coast of Australia.</p>

<p>Another type, perhaps more food than water-carrier, is common
on Melville and Bathurst Islands; it is made of a single
piece of the “stringy-bark” eucalypt. An oblong sheet, say a
good yard long and nearly half as wide, is freshly cut and
folded transversely at its centre. The edges of both sides are
pared down, laid flat, one over the other, and sewn or laced
together with plain or “run-on” stitches. A row of slanting
and overlapping stitches is often inserted along the open edge
a short distance down; and occasionally part of the same edge
may be cross-hemstitched and plastered with beeswax; the object
of these stitches is to prevent the bark tearing along the fibres.
The mouth of the carrier is nearly circular, or at any rate oval.
Ordinarily the bark is left in its raw condition, but upon
special occasions elaborate designs, consisting of circles, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
other figures, with cross-hatched line-patterns, are drawn on the
outer surfaces in red, yellow, white, and black.</p>

<p>An article is in use locally among the Worora at Port
George IV, which perhaps interests us most on account of its
similarity to the orthodox water-carrier employed by ourselves,
viz. the bucket. What makes the fact more interesting still is
that this unique type of water-vessel is found in a locality, than
which even at the present time none other is further remote
from civilization. The bark-bucket of the Worora, known
vernacularly as “<i>wirrauwa</i>,” is beyond doubt an indigenous evolution.
It is much like a bushman’s billycan in shape—a cylindrical
vessel closed at one end and with a handle at the other,
measuring from four to twelve inches in height, and from six
to nine inches in width. A circular piece of woolly-butt bark
is cut for the base, and this is surrounded by another sheet
which forms the cylinder. The joints are carefully stitched
together with threads of split cane, using a bone-awl to prick
the holes; then melted resin from the eucalyptus tree is applied
over the seam to render it water-tight. The edge of the open
mouth may be strengthened by cross-stitching and applying
resin. The handle is made of human hair-string, several pieces
of which are threaded diametrically across the open end of the
bucket, through holes previously made with a bone-awl, and
tied. The outer surfaces of the vessel are often painted. The
usual device consists of alternate bars of red and white or red
and black, joined at the top and bottom by horizontal lines of
red; occasionally the whole surface may be splashed or daubed
with white, or the above designs may be embellished with regularly
spaced dots and “emu tracks.”</p>

<p>Lastly we shall briefly refer to the skin water-bag which is
used (or has been used) by the desert tribes of central Australia,
from central Western Australia to Western Queensland.
A kangaroo, wallaby, euro, or dingo is killed and the animal’s
skin removed almost in toto by making a circular cut around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
its neck, and, whilst one or two men hold on to the head, others
detach the skin from the carcase and pull it off inside-out. The
neck-hole forms the mouth of the bag, but all the other openings
are tied, stitched, or pinned together. The limbs are cut off
near the paws, the tail near its root, and the resulting holes
securely tied with string. The limb-pieces are tied together
and act as straps to assist the native carrying the bag when
filled with water.</p>

<p>To fill these vessels with water, bailers are available either
in the form of specially constructed or of naturally occurring
objects; no matter which they are, they usually also answer the
purpose of drinking cups. Along the north coast of Australia
the large melon shell is perhaps the handiest; it is either used
as it is found or its inner whorls and columella are broken
away, leaving just the spacious outer shell to hold the water
like a bowl. The same remarks apply to the large <i>Fusus pricei</i>,
and other molluscs.</p>

<p>The Narrinyerri and other tribes south of Adelaide used
human calvaria as drinking vessels. The facial skeleton of a
complete skull was broken away so as only to leave the brain-box;
and this held the water.</p>

<p>The broken shells of the large boabab nuts are similarly used
in the Northern Kimberleys of Western Australia, and now
and then the broken shell of the emu egg also makes a very
serviceable cup.</p>

<p>A miniature bark-cooleman is constructed by the Wongapitcha,
Aluridja, and Arunndta tribes, like that described on
<a href="#Page_92">page 92</a>, about eight inches long and half as wide, which serves
the purpose of a bailer, drinking-vessel, fire-shovel, and special
food-carrier. It is strongly convex lengthwise, and therefore
comparatively deep.</p>

<p>The Bathurst Islanders tear or cut a piece of bark from a
tree, usually the ti-tree or “paper-bark,” out of which they
fashion a cup. The piece of bark measures about twelve inches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
in length, and eight in width. It is first folded longitudinally
at about its middle, and then both ends of the doubled piece
are folded transversely at about one-quarter the whole length.
The overturned parts of the inner sheet of the first fold are
clasped between the fingers on the inside and the thumb on the
outside, when the cup is ready for use.</p>

<p>The natural water supplies available over so vast an expanse
of territory as is embraced by the continent of Australia and its
subjacent islands, occur, as one might have expected, in great
variety. There is no need for us to consider such familiar
supplies as rivers, creeks, lakes, billabongs, waterholes, and
springs; we shall just briefly consider a few of the more uncommon
cases, which are of special interest. The native has a
wonderful instinct for locating hidden supplies of water; and
many a European wanderer has perished in the Australian bush,
within a stone’s throw of the life-saving fluid, all for the want
of that gift, which to the primitive inhabitant of the desert
central regions means his very existence.</p>

<p>Along the superficially dry, sandy beds of “rivers” in arid
Australia, he is able to pick sites, at which, by shallow digging
with his hands and yam-stick, he can in quick time produce a
“native well,” sufficient to supply the needs of all the camp.
The water is often exposed within a foot or two of the surface,
but at times he has to dig to a depth of from five to six feet,
which so far as my experience goes seems to be the limit. When
not in use, or when the camp moves on, the natives always take
care to cover the mouth of the well in order that wild animals
cannot reach the water and pollute it. When the well is deep,
its sides are made secure with pieces of timber and brushwood,
and cross-pieces are left to serve as a ladder whereby the native
can attain the water. Similar wells are constructed in the
catchment basins adjacent to the hills.</p>

<p>Rock-holes in granite (Musgrave Ranges), quartzite (Krichauff
Ranges), or limestone (Nullarbor Plains) are favoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
on account of the cool, clear water which they generally contain.
Where such are of a cavernous nature, and opening from a
bare inclined surface, the natives often build a small bank of
clay across the slope to direct the flow of water, resulting from
a downpour, towards the hole. A unique variety of this type
was discovered by us at Ullbönnalenna, east of the Musgrave
Ranges. Through a hole in the barren slope of gneiss, a communication
has been established by atmospheric denudation with
a small reservoir below. To obtain the water contained in it,
the natives keep a broom-shaped piston handy, with which they
pump the fluid to the surface, as required. The piston is merely
a rod, about five feet long, round one end of which a bundle
of brushwood is securely tied with string. The size of the
brushwood bundle is such that it exactly fits the hole in the
rock (about six inches). The implement is inserted, brushwood
foremost, and slowly pushed down into the water, and,
after a short interval, quickly withdrawn again. The water,
which had collected behind this “piston-head,” is thereby
forcibly ejected, and is collected inside a small enclosure of clay
built around the hole.</p>

<p>The aborigines are most particular about preserving their
water supplies against pollution, especially where such is brought
about by excremental and decaying animal matter. In the
Musgrave Ranges, the natives did not in the slightest object to
our camels being watered at the supplies they were dependent
upon, but when the animals dirtied the rocks above the hole
and there was a chance of the discharge running into the water,
they immediately set to and built a barrier of earth to intercept
the flow before it reached the hole.</p>

<p>In the Northern Kimberleys of Western Australia valuable
pools of water collect upon the boabab trees. The branches of
this species surround the “gouty” stem in a circle at the top,
like the heads of a hydra, and by this means form a concavity
between them, which is capable of storing a considerable volume<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
of cool, clear rain-water. To reach this water, the natives
construct ladders by simply driving a series of pointed pegs into
the soft bark of the tree one above the other.</p>

<p>Certain desert trees like the Currajong have the property of
retaining considerable quantities of water in their tissues, even
under the worst conditions of drought, for periods of many
weeks or months. This water the native obtains by felling the
tree and setting fire to the crown; the water oozes out from
the cut trunk and is collected in bark carriers. The “Bloodwood”
(<i>Eucalyptus corymbosa</i>) has similar properties.</p>

<p>In the Denial Bay district a remarkable mallee (<i>Eucalyptus
dumosa</i>) grows, whose roots supply the natives with water.
This mallee is a rather big tree, which lives in association with
other smaller species of the same genus. It appears, also, that
not every specimen of the particular species referred to contains
water; it requires the experience of an aboriginal to predict
which of the trees is likely to carry such. Having selected his
tree, the native proceeds to expose one of the lateral roots,
which grow in the sand at no great depth from the surface.
The root is then cut in two places, three or four feet apart,
and lifted from the ground in a horizontal position; finally it
is turned on end over a bark cooleman, when water, clear as
crystal, begins to drip from the lower end into the vessel.
Sufficient water can thus be collected to sustain the camp, if
need be, for even a longish period.</p>

<p>Other trees in central Australia are known to possess similar
properties though to a lesser extent, as for instance the Needle-Bush
(<i>Hakea lorea</i>, <i>var.</i> <i>suberea</i>).</p>

<p>When, after a good day’s march, the natives have the luck
to strike a big waterhole, each of the party immediately quenches
his thirst by literally “filling up” on the spot. Different methods
are adopted to accomplish this. Some prefer to remain prone
at the water’s edge, whilst others wade into the deeper parts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
of the hole, and, placing their hands upon their knees, stoop and
drink off the surface.</p>

<p>The Cambridge Gulf tribes pull a long-stalked leaf of the
water-lily, which, after they have cut it at top and bottom,
acts like a tube and permits them to suck the cooler fluid from
a depth.</p>

<p>After quenching his thirst, a native will on a hot day often
cool his system by pouring water on to his head. The women-folk
and children are very fond of splashing the head with
cold water, which they might do repeatedly during the day,
provided the opportunity is afforded. Bathing during the heat
of the day is also commonly enjoyed by all the northern tribes,
especially those resident in the tropics where water is abundant.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the chosen camp-site, each family group
at once busies itself clearing a patch of ground of any obstacles,
like stones and lumps of earth, the biggest of which are picked
up by hand or crushed by foot, the smaller brushed aside with
the sides of the feet. In addition, the women may be told to
sweep the ground with branches to clear it of grass-seeds and
burrs. Should it be that the spot is only reached after dusk,
the natives set fire to one or two dry bushes, the glare of which
supplies them with the necessary light.</p>

<p>Each adult scoops a “bed” for himself on the sand, and lights
a small fire on one or both sides of it.</p>

<p>The northern coastal tribes very often spread sheets of paper-bark
over the sand, and they might also cover their bodies with
similar material. Should the mosquitoes become a great nuisance,
one often sees them completely covered with sand.</p>

<p>The south-eastern tribes of Australia, including those of the
River Murray and Adelaide Plains, used skins and rugs made
of kangaroo and opossum skins, neatly sewn together, to lie
upon and under.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>The children sleep with or close to their parents. When an
aboriginal has more wives than one, his camp is subdivided
according to their number, and he sleeps with his favourite.</p>

<p>The strangest conditions reign on Groote Island in the Gulf
of Carpentaria, where the women practically live apart from
the men during the whole of the day, and only come into camp
after sundown to deliver the food supplies they have collected
over day. When on the march, every adult female carries two
big sheets of paper-bark with her, which she holds with her
hands, one in front and another behind her person. Whenever
a stranger approaches, they duck behind these sheets of bark,
as into a box, for cover.</p>

<p>No matter when or where an aboriginal camps, he constructs
a brushwood shelter or windbreak at the head-end of
his resting place. This consists of a few branches or tussocks
stuck in the ground or piled against any bush, which might be
growing upon the patch of ground selected. Under ordinary
circumstances, this is the only shelter erected.</p>

<p>Even under the best of conditions, the night’s rest of an
aboriginal is hard, and at times very cold and wet. It is not
an uncommon experience for a person to sit up part of the
night, hugging a fire, and when the sun is up to lie in its
warmth to make good the sleep lost.</p>

<p>During a run of wet weather or when the camp is to be of
a more permanent nature, different kinds of structures are
erected, or already existing habitations selected, which will
afford a better shelter than the crude structures referred to.</p>

<p>Natural caves or shelters beneath a sloping wall of rock,
although frequently chosen as a mid-day camp, are not favoured
on account of the superstitious dread of the evil spirit, whose
haunts are supposed to be in the rocks. Caves are in any case
only occupied during the heat of summer, the rocks being considered
too cold to sit and lie upon in winter. If possible, a
tribe will always make for the sandhill country in the winter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the sand making a very much softer and warmer bed. Such
caves as are regularly occupied almost invariably have the walls
and ceiling decorated with ochre drawings.</p>

<p>The opportunity of camping under large hollow tree-trunks,
when available, is never neglected in wet weather. In the
southern districts, as for instance the Adelaide Plains and along
the River Murray, the large red-gums, especially such as have
been partly destroyed by a passing bush-fire, supply the best
covers of this description, whilst on the north coast of Australia
the boabab occasionally becomes hollow in a like way,
and makes a very snug and roomy camp.</p>

<p>Huts are constructed after different patterns according to the
materials available. In the Musgrave Ranges, as in most
parts of central Australia, the usual plan is to ram an uprooted
dry trunk of mulga into the sand in an inverted position, so
that the horizontal root system rests at the top, generally about
five feet from the ground. Making this the central supporting
column, branches of mulga and other bushes are placed in a
slanting position against it, so that they rest between the roots
at the top and form a more or less complete circle at the base,
measuring some eight or nine feet in diameter. An opening is
left, away from the weather-side, large enough to permit of
free access. The spaces and gaps between the branches are
filled with small bushes, tussocks, and grass, and on top of it
all sand is thrown.</p>

<p>Very often the branches are placed around a standing tree
for a central support, and now and again they are simply made
to rest against one another in the required conical fashion.</p>

<p>Roof-like shelters are made by piling branches and brushwood
either upon the overhanging branches of a tree or across
two bushes which happen to be standing close together.</p>

<p>On Cooper’s Creek, in the extreme south-western districts
of Queensland, these huts are more carefully constructed. A
solid, almost hemispherical framework is erected consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
stout curved posts, with a prong at one end, so placed that the
prongs interlock on top and the opposite ends stand embedded
in the sand in a circle. Vide <a href="#plate15">Plate XV</a>, 1. The structure is
covered with the long reeds that abound along the banks of the
large waterholes of the Cooper. Some of the huts are indeed
so neatly thatched that they have quite a presentable appearance.</p>

<p>The eastern Arunndta groups, in the Arltunga district, cover
a light framework of mulga stakes, erected after the general
central Australian pattern, entirely with porcupine grass
(<a href="#plate15">Plate XV</a>, 2).</p>

<p>At Crown Point, on the Finke River, other groups of the
same tribe cover their huts with branches and leaves of the
Red Gum.</p>

<p>When camped on the great stony plains or “gibbers” of
central Australia, it is often very difficult to find a suitable
covering for the huts, the vegetation being either unsuitable or
too scanty. On that account the Yauroworka in the extreme
north-east of South Australia utilize the flat slabs and stones
which abound in that locality to deck their more permanent
domiciles with. The supporting structure must, of course, be
made particularly strong to carry the weight of the stones. The
crevices between the stones are filled with clay to render them
water-tight, and earth is banked up against the base of the walls
both inside and outside.</p>

<p>Along the north coast of Australia, from the Victoria River
to Cape York, the prevalent type of hut is a half-dome structure,
whose frame consists of a series of parallel hoops, stuck
into the ground and held in position by a number of flexible
sticks tied at right angles to the former with shreds of Hybiscus
bark. The ends of the cross-pieces are poked into the ground
on that side of the framework which will be opposite the
entrance of the hut when completed. The hoops are made of
slightly decreasing size from the entrance towards the back,
and so correspond in height with the upward curve of the cross-pieces.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
This skeleton-frame is covered with sheets of “paper-bark”
(<i>Melaleuca</i>) and grass; and the floor of the interior is
carpeted with similar material; a small space is however left
uncovered to hold the fire. Such a hut measures about five feet
by five feet at the base, and is four feet high. In Queensland
palm leaves may take the place of the paper-bark sheets.</p>

<p>In districts where the mosquitoes are very troublesome, the
dome is completed by erecting hoops on the open side as well,
and making the cross-switches long enough to be lashed to them
all and to be stuck into the sand at both ends. The whole
structure is covered with bark, but three or four small holes
are left along the base for the people to slip in by; and a
ventilation-hole is left at the top of the dome to allow the smoke
to escape from the fire, which is burned inside to keep out
the insects.</p>

<p>Provisional rain-shelters are made by cutting a big sheet of
bark from one of the eucalypts, usually the “stringy bark.”
To do this the bark is chopped through circumferentially on
the butt in two places, about seven or eight feet apart, slit
vertically between the two incisions, and removed by levering
it off with two chisel-pointed rods. The sheet is folded transversely
at its centre and stood upon the sand like a tent.</p>

<p>At times the sheet of bark is simply laid length-wise against
two or three sticks previously stuck into the ground. In the
more durable structures of this type, two forked poles are
rammed into the ground so that they can carry a horizontal
piece after the fashion of a ridge-pole of a tent. Against the
latter then are stood several sheets of bark at an angle of about
forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>Occasionally a scaffold is erected with four poles and cross-pieces
at the corners of an oblong space, and sheets of bark are
then laid across the top. The sheets are of sufficient length to
hang over the sides of the frame so that their weight bends
them into an arch along the centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>Commander Lort Stokes found similar structures near Roebuck
Bay in the north of Western Australia, but in place of
the bark they there had a slight, rudely-thatched covering.</p>

<p>In districts where thieving dogs, ants, or other vermin become
troublesome, the men construct platform-larders, upon which
any reserve supplies of meat are laid. Hawks are the greatest
nuisance in camp. It is astonishing with what fearlessness such
birds fly right into camp and swoop the meat from the natives.
As a protection against theft of this description, the campers
cover their stores with branches.</p>

<p>The position favoured during sleep is to lie upon one side,
with the legs drawn up towards the stomach and bent in the
knees. The head rests upon one or both hands; should one
hand not be so occupied, it is usually placed between the closed
thighs. At Delamere in the Victoria River country, the natives
were observed to have convex pieces of bark in their possession
which were used as head-rests during the night.</p>

<p>It goes without saying, of course, that the aboriginal might
at any time change his position during sleep to one of the many
commonly adopted by European or other people.</p>

<p>During the warm summer months, the campers are up with
the first glimpse of dawn, but when the nights become cold,
they often remain huddled by the fires until the sun is high up
in the sky.</p>

<p>When a messenger or visitor approaches a camp at night, he
will not do so without announcing his arrival in advance by
loudly calling from afar to the groups at the fireside. Should
a person be discovered prowling the surroundings of a camp,
without having heralded his coming, he runs grave risk of
being speared, on the chance that he be on no good business.</p>

<p>In the way of salutations, hand-shaking and kissing are unknown,
but when two friends meet it is quite the usual thing
for them to walk together for a while, hand-in-hand. When
a person, who has been long absent, returns to camp, everybody<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
is so overcome with joy that he starts crying aloud as if his
joy were grief.</p>

<p>On the occasion of friendly Arunndta groups visiting, all
members of both parties, male and female, approach each other
with their spears, boomerangs, shields, and fighting sticks. The
visitors first sit down in a body while the others walk around
them, in a widening course, flourishing their weapons high in
the air and shrieking with joy; later they return the civilities
by acting similarly.</p>

<p>When seating himself, an aboriginal always prefers the
natural surface of the ground to any artificial or natural object,
which might serve him in a manner suggestive of a chair.
Rocks and fallen tree-trunks might occasionally be used, and
children are sometimes seen sitting upon the lowest big branches
of trees, especially if they slope downwards to the ground. But
even in these cases they rarely allow the legs to dangle, preferring
to draw them, bent in the knee, close against the body,
and usually with the arms thrown around the legs or resting
upon the knees.</p>

<p>The men use the same method, when squatting at ease upon
the ground, keeping their thighs apart, heels touching and close
against the buttocks, with their elbows resting upon their knees
and their hands usually joined in front. When the hands are
to be used, the sitter acquires greater stability by placing the
feet further apart and swinging the arms over the knees.</p>

<p>Another common posture is to double the shins under the
thighs and rest them half-laterally upon the ground. This
method is frequently combined with the previously mentioned
by holding one leg one way and the other the other.</p>

<p>From either of these positions, the sitter may change by
tucking the shins well under the thighs and rolling on to the
side of one of his thighs.</p>

<p>Again, he may change by simply stretching his legs forward
full length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>These methods are made use of by men, women, and children
alike. Unless it be that the person prefers his legs to remain in
close apposition, whilst squatting in any of the positions indicated,
he will endeavour to hide his shame behind one of his
feet. This is particularly characteristic of the women, and
their natural sense of decency is prettily described in the
narration of the voyage in search of La Perouse as follows:
“Though for the most part they are entirely naked, it appears
to be a point of decorum with these ladies, as they sit with
their knees asunder, to cover with one foot what modesty bids
them conceal in that situation.”</p>

<p>By their method of standing at ease on one leg, the natives
of Australia have evolved a remarkable posture which reminds
one of birds. In this position, a man rests the sole of his unoccupied
foot against the knee of the standing leg, and usually
props his body with a spear-thrower (<a href="#plate16">Plate XVI</a>, 2).</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, it is the duty of the women to gather firewood,
although very often, when there is a supply close at
hand, the men will also drag a few logs to the family camp.
The women, on the other hand, are required to collect sufficient
to keep the fire going, during the day for cooking purposes and
during the night for warming and lighting purposes. At times
this entails weary searching and long-distance marching. We
have already referred to the way they lift the pieces of wood
from the ground, between the toes of one foot, to the hand on
the opposite side, by passing the piece behind the body; the same
hand next stacks the wood upon the head, where the other
holds and steadies it. By this method, the gin has no need
to stoop, and can in consequence build up astonishingly high
piles of wood upon her head (<a href="#plate17">Plate XVII</a>). A small pad is
usually first laid upon the head to prevent the scalp from chafing
and the wood from slipping. Arrived at the camp, a gin throws
her load to the ground and breaks the longer pieces across her
head with her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>A native’s idea of a good fire is to keep it as small as
possible, but, at the same time, to derive a cheerful glow from
it. His opinion of the European traveller’s camp-fire is that
it is so ridiculously big that one cannot lie near to it, without
being scorched. In the winter the native often selects a large
dry log if available and keeps this aglow at one end throughout
the night; in the absence of such a log, he will at frequent
intervals find it necessary to attend to his fire during the cold
hours of the night. So diligently, indeed, does he nurse his
fire that his eyes often become inflamed in consequence of the
continued irritation by smoke when he fans a smouldering flame
with his breath.</p>

<p>A small fire like this, especially when it has burned for some
time, is quite sufficient to cook all the smaller articles, which
constitute the daily bill of fare, as for instance roots, tree-grubs,
and lizards.</p>

<p>When, however, big game like a kangaroo is to be prepared,
larger fires are essential and special culinary rules observed. A
method, which has been in use practically everywhere in Australia,
and is still found in use among the uncontaminated
tribes, is to burn a big fire for a while upon a sandy patch, and
then to lay a number of flat stones upon the red-hot coals and
cover everything with sand. After a while the sand is scraped
aside and the oven is ready for use. In the Northern Territory
the stones are substituted by brick-like lumps broken off one
of the tall termite-hills, which abound in that country.</p>

<p>In south-eastern Australia and along the River Murray the
stones selected are usually composed of travertine or limestone.</p>

<p>In the Musgrave Ranges oven-stones are not in use, the game
being simply laid upon, and covered with, hot ashes and sand.</p>

<p>“Big” cooking is done by the men, whilst the women are
required to attend to the preparation of all smaller articles
like yams, grubs, and seeds.</p>

</figure>

<p>Slight variations are noticed in the method of cooking a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
kangaroo according to the locality. In the Musgrave Ranges,
the animal is prepared whole. The skin is not detached, whilst
the bony paws may, or may not, be removed beforehand in
order to secure the sinews, which are used all over Australia
for tying purposes in the manufacture of their implements and
weapons. The carcase is laid upon its back and completely
covered with hot ashes and sand, and thus permitted to cook.
When sufficiently, and that according to our ideas often means
only partly, cooked, the skin can easily be removed. The belly
of the baked carcase is cut open and the gut laid aside. What
remains is then pulled to pieces by hand and the portions distributed
among all members having a right to such. The meat
is tender and juicy when cooked this way. Even the intestines,
after their contents have been squeezed out by the aid of two
fingers, are eaten by the less privileged members of the tribe.
The Arunndta call the last-named dish “<i>uttna kalkal</i>.” Most
of the bones, if not crushed between the jaws, are shattered
between two stones and the marrow eaten.</p>

<p>The Wogait and other tribes on the north coast break the
legs of the animal and tie them together in pairs with shreds
of Hybiscus bark. The carcase is opened at one side to remove
the entrails, and an incision is also made into the anus to clear
it. In the case of a kangaroo, the tail is cut off and cooked
separately in ashes. The skin is not removed. When thus
prepared, the animal is transferred to an oven as described above
and first covered with a piece or two of “paper-bark,” then with
hot sand and ashes.</p>

<p>In order that they may readily scoop out a fireplace, scrape
the sand to and from the roast, and handle the meat, vegetable,
seed-cake, or whatever the article in the oven might happen
to be, the Northern Kimberley tribes have invented a long
wooden shovel. This is a slightly hollowed blade, about three
feet in length, four inches wide at the lower end, and decreasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
in width at the hand end. The implement is mostly cut out of
a sheet of eucalyptus bark.</p>

<p>The central tribes generally make use of a discarded or defective
boomerang, which seems to answer the purpose very well.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important article a native possesses is the
fire-stick. No matter where he might be, on the march or in
camp, it is his constant companion. Important as it is, the
fire-stick is only a short length of dry branch or bark, smouldering
at one end. It is carried in the hand with a waving
motion, from one side to another. When walking in the dark,
this motion is brisker in order to keep alive sufficient flame for
lighting the way. A body of natives walking in this way at
night, in the customary Indian file, is indeed an imposing sight.
Directly a halt is made, a fire is lit, to cook the meals at day
and to supply warmth during sleep at night. When camp is
left, a fresh stick is taken from the fire and carried on to the
next stopping place.</p>

<p>In consequence of carrying the fire-stick too close to the body
during cold weather, most of the natives have peculiar, irregular
scars upon abdomen and chest which have been caused by burns.
The Wongapitcha call these marks “<i>pika wairu</i>.”</p>

<p>If by accident the fire should become extinguished, a fresh
flame is kindled by one of the methods depending upon the
friction and heat which are produced by rubbing two pieces of
wood together. Two methods are in use, all over Australia
and the associated islands to the north; the one is by means of
the “fire-whisk,” the other by the “fire-saw.”</p>

<p>In the first-mentioned case, two pieces of wood are used,
usually a flat basal piece, with a small circular hollow in its
centre, and a long cylindrical stick, rounded at one end. The
native assumes a sitting position with his legs slightly bent in
the knees. He places the flat piece of wood upon the ground
and holds it securely beneath his heels. The rounded point is
now inserted into the small hollow, and, holding the stick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
vertically between the flat palms of his hands, the native briskly
twirls it like a whisk (<a href="#plate22">Plate XXII</a>). The twirling action is,
however, not backwards and forwards, but in one direction only.
After a while, the wood dust that accumulates by the abrasion
begins to smoke, then smoulder. Suddenly the native throws his
stick aside, and quickly stooping over the smoking powder, gently
blows upon it whilst he adds a few blades of dry straw or other
easily inflammable material. When the smouldering dust has
been coaxed into flame, more straw and twigs are added, then
larger pieces of wood, until eventually a blazing fire results.</p>

<p>Often a small notch is cut at the side of the central hollow
in order that the smouldering powder might find its way down
to a piece of bark placed beneath the basal stick, and there, by
the aid of gentle blowing, ignite the dry grass, which was
previously laid upon the bark for that purpose.</p>

<p>Usually, during the process of twirling, a little fine sand
is placed upon the hollow to increase the friction. A curious
practice was observed among the Larrekiya at Port Darwin,
which seems to be opposed to the friction principle. When the
fire-maker has, by careful twirling, adjusted the point of the
upright stick, so that it fits nicely into the hole in the basal
piece, he squeezes a quantity of grease from the sebaceous glands
of his nose, which he scrapes together with his finger-nails and
transfers in a lump to the ankle of his left foot. Then he
resumes the twirling, and, so soon as the stick begins to smoke,
he applies its hot end to the grease, which spreads itself over
the point. The stick having been thus lubricated, the process
is continued as before.</p>

<p>The central tribes, like the Dieri, Wongapitcha, and Aluridja,
usually make the basal piece short and flat, and wider than the
twirling stick. The Dieri select needlebush for the twirling
stick, and Hack’s Pea (<i>Crotalaria</i>) for the basal piece. The
other tribes mentioned combine the needlebush wood with that
of a mulga root.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>The northern tribes almost invariably employ two long sticks,
one of which has a rounded point at one end, the other a series
of shallow circular pits, into which the point of the twirling
piece just described fits when the implement is in use.</p>

<p>The Mulluk-Mulluk, Ponga-Ponga, and other tribes of the
Daly River district carry a number of these sticks about with
them, especially in the rainy season, when there is always a
chance of the fire-stick being extinguished by an unexpected
tropical deluge. The fire-making apparatus is carried in a receptacle,
which consists of a single segment of a bamboo, with
a septum at the bottom. The sticks are stuck into this cylindrical
holder, which keeps them perfectly dry even during a
prolonged season of rain, after the fashion of arrows in a quiver.</p>

<p>Fire-making implements are carried by the men, whilst the
fire-stick is, as often as not, carried by the women also. As
we have already seen in connection with the carriage of water,
it is the concern of the women to undertake the transport of
the camp-belongings from one site to another. When moving
they pack themselves with the domestic implements, collecting-vessels,
personal paraphernalia, and their infants, whilst their
husbands burden themselves only to the extent of a few spears,
a spear-thrower, and the fire-producing sticks just mentioned.
The men declare that it would be most unwise to be burdened
with any impediment themselves, while on the march, because
at any moment, and when least expected, they might be pounced
upon by an enemy, who would make good use of their unpreparedness.
So also, should game of any kind suddenly come
into view, the men, who are the recognized hunters, must always
be ready for quick action, or in a position to take up the chase
immediately. Hence it comes about that in the best interests
of the tribe the women are required to undertake the transport.</p>

The rule of the camp is never to lay a spear upon the ground
for any length of time for two reasons; firstly, to prevent it
from warping, and secondly, to eliminate the risk of breakage
by somebody carelessly walking on to it. For these reasons
the men, when camped, always take the precaution to stand
their spears in a more or less upright position against the
entrance of their huts, or against any bush or tree which happens
to be growing close at hand.</p>

<p>Whenever possible, the opportunity of a sojourn in camp is
seized for conducting a festive dance and song. For this purpose
head-gears and other decorations have to be manufactured,
plumes and permanent ornaments renovated, and pigments prepared
to adorn the persons taking part in the performance.
Upon such occasions a native is never seen idle.</p>

<p>Quite apart from preparing himself in anticipation of an
extraordinary event, however, a native might take advantage
of a delay in camp to manufacture an article with which he can
barter with an adjoining tribe. The most common article thus
prepared is ochre. Many tribes do not possess a deposit of this
natural pigment and they are most anxious to do business with
their neighbours. In exchange for the ochre, they offer such
things as weapons, pitjuri-leaf, fish, or yams. The ochre is
carried to its destination either in lumps or prepared as a fine
powder. In the former case it is packed in small fibre or fur-string
bags; in the latter the powder is wrapped in thin sheets
of bark and tied together with string into neat parcels. The
preparation of the ochre-powder entails much grinding between
the stone surfaces of a hand-mill. The ochre is used for
decorating the body, as well as implements and weapons.</p>

<p>If now we enquire into the method of dress adopted by the
aborigines of Australia, we find that most of the tribes originally
walked about in the nude, and, apart from a few small personal
decorations, possessed nothing in the shape of a covering which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
might be described as a dress. The advent of civilization has
largely interfered with this ancient practice.</p>

<p>The now practically extinct south-eastern tribes, including
those along the River Murray, used more of a body-covering
than any others. Opossum, wallaby, and any suitable marsupial
skins were collected and carefully sewn together, and with these
rugs the natives could, if need be, cover the greater part of
their bodies.</p>

<p>By far the most common mode is to tie a string around the
waist, from which is suspended a tassel to cover the pubes.
These tassels vary considerably in size according to the tribe
which wears them. The smallest are found among the Wongapitcha
in the Mann and Tomkinson Ranges; the appendage is
there only worn by the men and is barely large enough to cover
the part. It is made of human hair strands fastened at the
knot of the tassel directly to the pubes; the covering is known
as the “<i>moiranje</i>.” As a general rule, it might be said that
the northern tribes have larger coverings than the central,
although the Yantowannta and other Barcoo River tribes wear
them as large as any. Even the Arunndta and Aluridja at
special functions suspend large pubic tassels of fur-string from
the waist-band.</p>

<p>The northern type of tassel consists of a great number of
strings, usually of opossum fur, bound to a central piece, which
is attached to the waist-band, either by two separate terminal
strings, or by means of one single tie from the top of the tassel.
The completed covering hangs from the waist like an apron.
This type of pubic tassel is known to all north-central and
northern tribes, and might be worn by either adult male or
married female.</p>

<p>In place of the tassel a small sheet of the paper-bark is
popular amongst the north coastal tribes. A narrow strip, from
eight to twelve inches long, is folded transversely at its middle
and hung over the waist-band, from which it pends like an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
apron as described of the tassel. Captain Matthew Flinders is
perhaps the first European to have observed this custom, as far
back as 1803, at Caledon Bay, where he observed a girl wearing
“a small piece of bark, in guise of a fig leaf, which was the sole
approximation to clothing seen.”</p>

<p>The women of Bathurst Island carry folded sheets of the
paper-bark or large food-carriers about with them, which, upon
the approach of strangers, they hold in front of their person.</p>

<p>Along the whole length of coast line of north Australia, the
large shell of the pearl-oyster is made use of as a pubic
covering. Even among such tribes as live remote from the sea,
one may occasionally find the shell so used, in which case, of
course, it has been acquired from a coastal tribe by barter. In
order to hang the shell, two holes are drilled through it near
the hinge line, at the top, and a string passed through them,
with which it is tied to a belt. The rough exterior surface of
the shell is ground smooth; and it is this side which lies against
the body. The nacreous inner surface is frequently decorated
with either painted designs or carvings subsequently tinted with
ochre. The Sunday Island natives are especially adept at this
type of decorative art, which will be referred to later.</p>

<p>Although the aboriginal does not wear much clothing, he is
very particular about regularly anointing his supple skin. This
precaution no doubt gives him greater protection against the
changes of weather than all the modern ideas of clothing could
do. What he principally applies is fat of emu and goanna, and
on the north coast that of some of the larger fish as well. The
emu in particular, and especially during a good season, accumulates
masses of fat under its skin, which are readily removed,
when slain by the hunter. This grease the native rubs over the
whole surface of his body to shield the skin from the painful
sting of the broiling sun and of the arid wind. In addition
he covers certain parts of his body and face with red ochre and
charcoal, both for cosmetic and protective purposes. The application<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
of coloured pigments for purely decorative and ceremonial
purposes will be discussed later.</p>

<p>Hair-belts are worn by young and old, male and female.
Children have only one or two twisted fur-strings tied around
the waist. Among the coastal tribes of the Northern Territory,
men wear belts made of twisted human hair. A skein of about
thirty strings is tied at two points diametrically opposite, and,
making these the ends, the sixty strings are loosely twisted
into a hank about two feet in length. The belt thus completed
is tied around the waist with a piece of human hair-string.
The article is of practical use since it permits of carrying various
implements and weapons, which a man sticks between the belt
and his body. A Wogait warrior was seen with a tomahawk
thus placed at the back of his body; to stay the swinging of the
handle he held it securely in the cleft between his buttocks.
The same type of belt is used by the tribes of the Northern
Kimberleys, and there they are always chosen when a man is
wearing the pearl-shell appendage.</p>

<p>The Worora construct more elaborate articles by winding
much human hair-string circumferentially (i.e. spirally) round
a thick inner skein like the one described above. The finished
belt looks like a cylindrical ring about an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>Other kinds of belts are made, but they are more for gala
occasions, as when ceremonies are performed and tribal dances
arranged.</p>

<p>When his affairs are working harmoniously, game secured,
and water available, the aboriginal makes his life as easy as
possible; and he might to the outsider even appear lazy. Blessed
with a fair share of pristine philosophy by heredity, his motto
might be interpreted in words to the effect that while there is
plenty for to-day never care about to-morrow. On this account
an aboriginal is inclined to make one feast of his supplies, in
preference to a modest meal now and another by and by. The
result is that, when a beast has been roasted, the whole of it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
is eaten, even though the participant family or group be small
in comparison with the bulk of the spread. In consequence of
this custom, the surfeiters find it necessary in times of plenty
to frequently lie in camp, in undisguised idleness, until such
time has lapsed as Nature must demand of their systems to
overcome the discomforts which the reckless gorging had
brought about. During this period of digestive recovery, an
aboriginal endeavours to spend most of his time in sleeping off
the objectionable after-effects of his temporary indiscretion.
As an apology, however, one must admit that only too often
the same individual is compelled to go for many days without
even a mouthful to eat, and possibly, at the same time existing
on a minimum of water, under the most trying conditions
imaginable—conditions whose origin must be traced to the cycles
of drought the great southern continent is heir to, and which
have become more drastic in their effects, since the coming of
the white man, through the extermination of many indigenous
animals and plants the original owners of the land used to
depend upon for their existence.</p>

<p>It is during the leisure hours of any stay in camp that attention
is paid to such operations as hair-cutting and beard-removing
previously referred to. When the natives have been
on the march for a time, and especially after they have been
out hunting or collecting, numbers of thorns, prickles, and
splinters are picked up by the soles of their feet, in spite of
the thick horny nature of the skin. Many of these break off
short and in due course set up irritation, necessitating their removal.
Firstly the sufferer tries to remove the foreign body
from the skin with his finger-nails; failing to succeed by this
method, he cuts a small piece of wood the shape of an awl,
and with its sharp point removes the obstacle. The prickle is
often completely buried and quite invisible to the eye, yet it has
to be removed. In order to locate it under those conditions,
the aboriginal resorts to the method, not infrequently applied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
by the modern surgeon, of gently pressing the skin at different
places with the tip of the instrument until the seat of pain
has been located. At that spot he cuts away the skin to a
depth sufficient to expose the hidden body, which he can then
in most cases express with his fingers. During these operations
the natives repeatedly give vent to a sharp, yet subdued “<i>irr</i>,”
combining the expression of pain with that of disgust or temper.</p>

<p>The method adopted by the natives of walking one behind
the other, where possible, is partly to minimize the risk of
picking up prickles with their feet, and partly to obliterate the
individual tracks of the party.</p>

<p>The dog is the aboriginal’s constant companion. In the
original tribal areas the dingo, Australia’s wild dog, is captured
and tamed young; in the more civilized districts the European
dog has been acquired and bred by the natives in alarmingly
large numbers. The animals are kept by both man and woman—in
a single wurley one might count as many as fifteen dogs
living with the human occupants. The yelping hordes are
useless, except perhaps that they raise the alarm when strangers
approach the camp. Some of them are indeed dangerously
vicious. The natives have the dogs about them merely for the
love they bear towards them; it is on account of the unreasonable
amount of petting and pampering, received at the hands
of their masters, that the dogs become so thoroughly useless.
A native just holds the unruly mob about him for company
sake; he prefers to rely upon his own skill and instinct when
hunting, and rarely allows his dogs to go with him; in fact,
there seems little inclination on the part of the dogs to accompany
the chase with their master. They are so well looked
after, and regularly steal so much from the general supplies of
the camp, that they grow fat and lazy. When a dog seems to
be off colour, or has been accidentally hurt, it is nursed like a
sick child; it is placed by the fireside, upon the best rug available,
and covered with other rags, the natives themselves going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
without any covering. One might occasionally find a gin going
so far as to even suckle a pup at her breast.</p>

<p>Interesting discussions have taken place as to whether the
dingo is indigenous to Australia or whether it has come hither
from some other land, possibly with man. The wild dog found
in the mountains of Java certainly resembles the dingo very
closely. Whether or no, the dingo has existed in Australia
quite as long as the primitive tribes. Osseous remains of the
wild dog have been found contemporaneous with the extinct
Diprotodon and other pre-historic monsters. Indeed in the
“mammalian drifts” filling the ancient valleys of the ranges in
the Noarlunga district, south of Adelaide, bones of such animals
have been found showing distinctly the teeth-marks of the dingo
upon them. In Victoria, and New South Wales also, dog
remains have been found in old cave deposits in company with
fossil-mammals and struthious birds, often buried beneath the
basaltic flows and ashes of Mount Gambier and other volcanoes,
which have long since become dormant. It seems most probable,
therefore, that the dingo existed in Australia in the Pliocene
period, or at any rate in that immediately following it. It is
a strange circumstance that the dingo has never been traced to
Tasmania, although, immediately opposite that island on the
mainland, the dog was most plentiful in by-gone times. The
surmise is that the animal had in its migration not reached so
far south before Tasmania was severed from the Australian
continent by the breaking through of Bass Strait. It is reasonable
to assume then that the dingo came to the south of Australia
subsequent to the aboriginals who inhabited Tasmania.</p>

<p>Nothing surpasses the pleasure of real pristine chase. The
aboriginal’s ideal of life is attained when he finds himself in
hot pursuit of the game, which shares with him the wilds of
his ancient haunts. He lives at an accelerated pace; his pulse
quickens, and in his excitement he completely dissociates his
mind from everything but the spoor of his prospective prey.
His vision is focussed rigidly upon the fleeing animal—he is
blind so far as any other objects are concerned—and, behind
it, he beholds just the one picture of his ambition realized, <i>viz.</i>
the “kill.”</p>

<p>The love of the sport, the keenness of the senses, and the
astounding powers of endurance are natural attributes, which
the aboriginal alone knows how to use to their fullest. These
are the hereditary gifts of man which characterize the primitive
hunter; and these are the instincts which modern representatives
of the human species have deplorably neglected.</p>

<p>The object of the chase is, of course, in its original phase,
to find the means wherewith to sustain the hunter’s existence.
Although he loves the sport so well, a native will never kill
wantonly; whatever is slain is eaten; to kill just for the pleasure
of the thing is beyond his comprehension and clashes seriously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
with his profound notions of justice and fair-play being meted
out to all his fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Apart from some of the flabby marine creations, there are
few things in the animal world which the aboriginal does not
eat, either raw or cooked in ashes. Generally speaking, the
male only hunts the larger mammals and such things as require
expert knowledge to locate, or the taking of which is associated
with adventure and skill. We shall consider a few items
separately.</p>

<p>The larger land-snails are collected by the women in their
food-carriers. After a good downpour of rain such come out
from their hiding places in great numbers and can be collected
in large numbers, but even in midsummer, in the ranges of
central Australia, a meal of snails can at any time be secured
by searching under tussocks and beneath stones. The principal
species eaten by the Aluridja, Wongapitcha, and to a less extent
by the Arunndta tribes, is the <i>Helix perinflata</i>. When sufficient
have been collected, they are merely thrown upon hot ashes to
roast and then picked out of the shell with a small pointed stick.</p>

<p>Fresh water mussels are gathered from the mud, roasted and
consumed. These molluscs, known as the <i>Unio</i>, are very
plentiful in some of the permanent water-holes, such as exist
along the Cooper and Strzelecki Creeks in the Yantowannta,
Wongkanguru, and Dieri country. Along the banks of the
River Murray great heaps of the shells of such mussels are
encountered by travellers even nowadays, indicating to what an
enormous extent the molluscs were eaten by the extinct river
tribes.</p>

<p>Countless marine species, both heliform gastropods like the
periwinkle and cockle-like bivalves, contribute towards the daily
meals of the coastal tribes. All along the south-eastern shores
of South Australia, that is, upon the cliffs occurring between
Kingston and the Glenelg River and in Victoria, many kitchen
middens are still to be found containing heaps upon heaps of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the large <i>Turbo undulata</i>—the remains of what the local tribes
have feasted upon. Associated with these heaps are the stones
of their ovens and other camp refuse.</p>

<p>The cliffs and reefs, which fringe the north coast of Australia,
are profitable hunting grounds where all kinds of shell-fish,
especially oysters, abound. The last-named are gathered
and thrown upon hot ashes; when the valves open, the “fish”
are detached without any difficulty and swallowed.</p>

<p>The Wongapitcha and other desert tribes do not hesitate to
consume quantities of green caterpillars, but such usually only
at the beginning of a good season, when fresh herbs are available,
and the morsel is in consequence claimed to have acquired
a sweetish flavour. The only treatment the caterpillars receive
is to be thrown upon hot ashes until they expand and straighten
with the heat. The small hairs covering them are thus singed
off, but the caterpillars are far from being cooked when eaten.</p>

<p>The most popular and at the same time most widely distributed
article of diet in the insect line is the larva of the big
<i>Cossus</i> moth, commonly known as the witchedy grub (<a href="#plate18">Plate
XVIII</a>). The two varieties which make themselves most conspicuous
are, firstly, one living in the roots of such shrubs as the
Cassia and certain species of Acacia, and, secondly, one which
bores into the butt of the eucalyptus. The first cannot usually
be located by the eye, but its presence is determined by ramming
the yam-stick into the ground under the root of the shrub and
testing its resistance to leverage—if the grub is present, the root
will readily snap, whereupon the native soon unearths it by
digging with the stick and his hands. This variety is smaller
than the tree-grub and is mostly of a yellow colour.</p>

<p>The abode of the tree-grub is detected by the native’s keen
eye in the small holes the young larva bores into the bark and
lives in until it attains the mature moth stage. The larva lives
in the butt or in any of the larger limbs of the tree; consequently
it may at times be concealed in the bark high above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
the ground. In the latter case the native will have to climb
the butt and effect an ascent, no matter what the shape of the
tree happens to be. Various methods are made use of, one of
which we have already considered on <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>.</p>

<p>One of the commonest methods is to cut shallow notches in
the bark of the butt, one above the other, and so placed that the
toes of either foot of the climber can be placed into them,
alternately right and left. The climber, as he ascends, cuts
fresh notches into the bark with his tomahawk; and if the butt
is so big that he cannot hold on to it, he is obliged to cling to a
notch with the fingers of one hand whilst the other hand is used
to cut the new notch above it. In this manner he works his way
upwards to the nearest lateral branch, whence the ascent is in
most cases easier. It is wonderful with what assurance and ease
the native accomplishes this dangerous task; and one marvels
how it is possible for him to retain his balance against the vertical
trunk of the tree. The notches, too, which he cuts into the
bark, are so shallow that only the very toe-tips can be inserted.
One uncertain movement, or one slip of either toe or finger,
and he would fall to the ground; and considering the height
to which he occasionally climbs, this might mean certain death.
All grub-holes are examined on the way up and the occupants
extracted. Vide <a href="#plate19">Plate XIX</a>, 1.</p>

<p>When the diameter of the butt is not too large to prevent
the native from holding his hands around the distant side, the
notches are dispensed with, and the climber simply “walks”
up the tree, keeping his arms extended and allowing his hands
to slide along the surface as he ascends. The method is in
vogue principally in the tropical portions of Australia, where
small-trunked trees and palms are plentiful in the jungles
surrounding permanent water-holes and rivers.</p>

<p>In the same region, strong vines and creepers, which are
interlaced with the branches of a tree to be explored, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
climbed, hand over hand, by the hunter, who gets his hold by
gripping the stem between the big and second toes.</p>

<p>In north-eastern Queensland, tree-climbing is accomplished
by the aid of a long and strong piece of the lawyer-cane, which
is passed around that side of the tree-trunk lying away from
the climber. The native seizes both ends of this loop, one in
either hand, and keeping it taut by throwing his body backwards
into a sloping position, he places his feet against the tree.
Momentarily relaxing the strain upon the cane, by a jerk from
his arms, he thrusts the loop a short distance up the trunk, at
the same time lifting one foot above the other as though he
were walking up a ladder. The same operation is repeated,
when the other foot is lifted; and thus he makes quick progress
towards the first lateral branches of the tree. Should at any
time the climber want to use one of his hands, he passes one
end of the cane under the knee of the same side as the hand
to be liberated and holds the end between the big toe and that
next to it.</p>

<p>Often the natives do not climb the tree, but prefer to light
a fire at the base of it and wait until the flame has eaten its
way through sufficiently far to fell it. After a giant of the
woods has crashed to the ground, it is comparatively easy for
the hunters to obtain any spoil concealed in its bark, hollows,
or branches.</p>

<p>Although we have considered the methods of tree-climbing
in connection with the witchedy grub, it must be understood
that the same methods are employed in hunting small animals,
in bird-nesting, in honey-collecting, and so forth.</p>

<p>The witchedy grub is extracted from its hiding place by
means of a light hooked stick. This implement is from four
to six inches long and is usually cut from a small pronged
twig, one arm of which is left the required length, the other
cut short and sharpened to form the hook. The stick is inserted
into the hole occupied by the witchedy grub, hook foremost,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
and pushed in until the grub is penetrated; then it is withdrawn,
the hook bringing the grub with it. As the hole is
usually small at its entrance, the bark is first cut away to a
small depth with a tomahawk in order to avoid the constriction
when the grub is being withdrawn. The witchedy-hook is
known throughout central and southern Australia; the
Arunndta word for it is “<i>ullyinga</i>.”</p>

<p>The witchedy grub is prepared like most things already
described, namely, by throwing it upon hot ashes for a few
moments until it straightens and expands, but does not burst.
Although we Europeans have become adverse to eating anything
in the grub line, there are many bush people who regularly
partake of the witchedy; indeed, by many the grub is regarded
as a very tasty dish. The flavour of the cooked witchedy is
like that of scrambled egg, slightly sweetened.</p>

<p>The eggs and fledglings of all birds yield abundant food
supplies during favourable seasons. In central Australia such
seasons are dependent entirely upon the rains. Birds breed
usually after the setting in of rain, which might be once or
twice a year, but in the driest regions, like the Victoria Desert,
perhaps only once every few years. There is no doubt that emu,
black swan, and native goose are amongst the biggest suppliers
of eggs. Of the two last-named birds, in particular, enormous
harvests of eggs are occasionally wrested during exceptional
seasons. At these times the tribes who have been so bounteously
favoured carry on a regular trade with neighbouring tribes,
who have perhaps not had the same opportunity or good fortune.</p>

<p>The eggs of the larger birds mentioned are laid upon, or
into, hot sand and frequently turned to ensure them cooking
on all sides. The desert tribes of the Kimberley district have
a knack of snatching the egg, as it lies upon the hot ashes,
spinning it in the air, catching it again, and replacing it on to
the ashes. The process might be repeated two or three times.
The idea is to stir up the contents of the egg, in order that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
they may cook uniformly, much after the style of an omelette
or scrambled egg.</p>

<p>The eggs of lizards, crocodiles, turtles, and other reptiles
are also feasted upon. Of turtles in particular great numbers of
eggs are collected along the north coast of Australia. The female
turtle comes out of the ocean and lays many eggs in the sand,
a short distance above high water mark; between fifty and
sixty eggs are commonly found in a single nest. The turtle
lays the eggs into a hole it previously scoops out, and covers
them with sand it piles up with its paddles. The aboriginal
locates the nest by tracking the characteristic spoor across the
sand. When the nest has been discovered, the hunter probes
the pile with a pointed stick or spear to ascertain whether the
eggs are still available. This he can presage by looking at the
point of the stick when he withdraws it: if the eggs are freshly
laid, the point will be covered with yellow yolk, if partly
hatched blood will show itself. The eggs are eaten in either
condition. The lucky hunter, immediately he finds a nest, digs
out the eggs with his hands and yam stick, and carries them in
a food-vessel back to camp. Their preparation is much the
same as that of birds’ eggs, but, in the case of the turtle’s, the
white of the egg does not coagulate.</p>

<p>Snakes and lizards, especially the larger species, contribute
towards the daily meals. They are tracked to their holes and
hiding places and dug out. Great catches are made in the
northern coastal districts by setting fire to areas covered with
long, dry grass. The hunting party surrounds the burning
patch and kills the reptiles, as they are driven out of their
hiding places by the heat. Many creatures are overtaken by
the flames and partially roasted before they can escape. These
are collected as soon as the ground permits of walking over it,
but very often such morsels fall into the claws of the birds of
prey, which hover over the place directly the fires are started.
In order to ensure a rapid spread of the flames, the natives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
make use of a stick, about a yard long, with a hook at one end.
With this stick in their hand, they pick up some of the blazing
grass at the hook-end, and run with it along and through the
grass, setting fire to as much as they can, and in as short a
time as possible.</p>

<p>Of the lizards, the most favoured are the species of <i>Varanus</i>,
popularly known as the printhy and the goanna. These species
live in central and northern Australia and attain a considerable
size, the printhy in particular, living in the MacDonnell and
Musgrave Ranges, attain a size of over six feet. These lizards
in a good season are considered a delicacy, and the fat is prized
as nutriment, as medicine, or as cosmetic ointment alike. The
lizards are slain either in the caves they inhabit or as they
are running from the hunter. In sandy stretches of country,
the smaller goannas are often dug out of the holes they dwell
in, and are killed on the spot.</p>

<p>Fishing is indulged in wherever the conditions permit of it.
Opportunities are naturally rare in central Australia, and are
restricted to only a few permanent water-holes along the
courses of river systems like the Cooper, Diamentina, and Finke.
In the northern rivers, which are nearly all permanently
flowing, as for example the Fitzroy, Prince Regent, Victoria,
Daly, Alligators, Roper, and Leichhardt, there is always an
abundant supply of fish available. A common method practised
both in central and northern Australia is to form a fishing
party of men and boys, who enter a water-hole at one end and
drive the fish before them, by making as much noise and splash
as possible, at the same time gradually working their way
towards the shallow water. Great care is taken not to allow
any of the prey to make its escape by darting back through the
line of the party into deep water again. Suddenly a final,
united drive is made, through which most of the terrified fish
find themselves in disastrously shallow water. In their frantic
endeavour to escape, they entangle themselves in the mud, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
can easily be grabbed by the members of the party. As fast
as the fish are taken by the men, they are thrown on to the
dry bank, where some gins are in readiness to seize them and
dispatch them by crushing their heads between their teeth.</p>

<p>Many of the larger fish living in the water-holes have the
habit of throwing themselves out of the water when the mud
is stirred up in it; lying high and dry upon the muddy banks
of the hole, they are easily seized by the natives and killed.</p>

<p>In the western rivers district of the Northern Territory,
after the water has dried up in the creeks, leaving only shallow
pools behind, the imprisoned fish are driven towards small inlets
by means of long bundles of grass and twigs held horizontally
in the water. In this way they are pushed forward on to the
bank, and the water filters back to the hole. The fish are
retained by the brushwood, from which they are easily extricated
by the hunters.</p>

<p>The Carpentaria tribes build ingenious races at suitable sites,
as for instance at a point where a river drains a billabong. By
means of a series of embankments, the water is conducted along
a number of constricted channels to long hollow logs, through
which it flows, and, subsequently, empties itself over stacks of
brushwood. The fish are entangled in the brushwood, whence
they are removed by the hunters to a place of safety.</p>

<p>Crawfish are traced in shallow pools by keeping a constant
look-out for the ends of their antennæ, which stick out above
the surface of the turbid water; the native seizes these, and,
with a jerk, hurls the crustaceans on to the bank.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the Victoria River district of the Northern Territory,
where there are suitable constrictions in shallow tidal-inlets
and creeks, the natives sit in a line across the opening at ebb-tide
after the following fashion: Each person squats with his
legs doubled in the knees, the thighs resting well apart and in
contact, one on either side, with those of his neighbours, who
are seated just as he. When the last of the water ebbs out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the fish endeavour to make through the line of the fishers, but
the moment one invades the angle contained by an aboriginal’s
thighs, it is immediately pounced upon, caught, and thrown
across to the women waiting on the shore.</p>

<p>In place of the human line, very often a net is spanned
across an ebbing inlet, being kept in a more or less vertical
position by a number of stakes, which are driven into the sand.
These nets are made of vegetable fibre twine, strung or knitted
together, after a loop-within-loop pattern, into pieces many
yards in length.</p>

<p>Barriers are also built across shallow inlets, which upon the
recession of the tide may occasionally retain large numbers of
fish. Such structures are plentiful in the Berringin territory
along the north coast, and in the Carpentaria Gulf country.</p>

<p>More temporary structures are made of branches and strips
of paper-bark, stayed by vertical piles, driven into the sand at
short distances apart. This type of barrier was seen mostly
across the beds of creeks such as the McKinlay, Cullen, and
Lennard.</p>

<p>A kind of noose is made by the Daly River tribes consisting
of a long piece of big meshwork, which is loosely suspended
across a narrow arm of water, or a creek, known to be frequented
by larger varieties of fish. Whilst endeavouring to
swim through the meshes of this contrivance, which at first
offers no material resistance to the attempt, the fish, in carrying
the noose onwards, forces its body partly through one of the
meshes. Some of the prey might succeed in slipping through,
others will pull the noose over their heads and fix the mesh
in such a position that it will move neither forwards nor backwards.
In this case, the fish will be obliged to linger until the
natives come along to ascertain what luck they have had, when
it is removed, together with any others which have met with a
similar fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>Practically all coastal tribes of Australia have made use of
fishing nets at some time or other. Nowadays only the far
northern coastal tribes still practise netting. The Daly River
tribes, the Wogait, Sherait, Larrekiya, Berringin, and others
construct nets after one and the same principle. Two hoops
are made of the long shoots of <i>Spinifex</i>, growing upon the sandhills
on the shore, usually by twisting two pairs of such pieces
together, respectively, and tying their ends so as to form a
complete ring, measuring about five feet in diameter. Round
the inside of this ring is tied a circular net made out of fibre
twine or of Hybiscus bark. The net is made by hand, after
the loop-within-loop method previously referred to. To use
the net, two natives, usually females, seize it with one hand
placed at either side of the rim. As they wade out to a suitable
depth, they hold the net between them, partly submerged and
slightly inclined, so that the lower edge is in advance of the
upper. In their free hands the gins carry branches, with which
they frequently beat the water on either side, so as to drive
any fish, within the beating radius, towards the centre of the
net. So soon as a fish is noticed to go inside, the net is quickly
turned up into a horizontal position and the captive bagged
(<a href="#figure03">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 3. Berringin women netting fish.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A constant watch is kept for large fish, which may be swimming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
close in to shore, in order that they might be dispatched
with a stone or throwing stick. Feeding stingrays are often
captured this way. When saw-fish come into shallow water,
the natives wade in, seize the fish by their tails, and throw
them up on to dry land before the dangerous “saws” can do
any harm.</p>

<p>The spear is a favourite weapon with which to obtain a fish.
A special type is used by the Larrekiya, Wogait, the Alligator
River, and other coastal tribes in the north. The spear is about
eleven feet long, has a shaft of reed or bamboo, and three
barbed prongs of ironwood grouped in a circle around the head
of the shaft. These spikes, measuring from twelve to fifteen
inches, are attached with resin and string or paperbark. The
barbs are short and directed backwards, each prong containing
from eight to eleven, gradually increasing in size from the
point towards the shaft. This trident-spear is used mostly for
salt-water fish, and is thrown with or without a spear-thrower.
The idea of the three spikes is to jam the fish so that it is held
by the retrorse barbs. The spearing is done either off reefs and
rocks, or simply by wading out into shallow water and securing
the prey as it emerges from sea-weed or swims near the sandy
bottom; many of the coastal and river tribes do much of their
spearing from the bow of a canoe. Some tribes make similar
fish-spears, but with two prongs only.</p>

<p>The Kimberley tribes of Western Australia, the island tribes
off the north coast and the north Queensland coastal tribes use
straight, pointed spears of mangrove wood, those of the
Crocker Island being exceptionally well finished and of harder
wood.</p>

<p>The tribes living more inland in the river districts of the
north also use a singly pointed, straight fish-spear. A native
does most of his fishing by perching himself upon a high bank,
rock, or fallen log, at a place where he knows fish are being
attracted to the surface of the water by flies or other causes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
He stands rigidly for hours, with his spear poised, patiently
waiting for the opportunity, which will allow him to thrust the
sharp point into the body of the unsuspecting prey. The spear
is thrown with such force that it either sticks in the mud below
or disappears under water for a while. In either case, the
native has to wade or swim out to the missile, and when he
retakes it, the fish, if he has been successful, is found sticking
to the end of the spear.</p>

<p>The hook and line are used by the Daly and Alligator River
tribes of the Northern Territory. Two types of hook are
employed. One is cut out of a pelvic bone or shoulder blade
of the kangaroo, or out of the pearl shell. It is of a strongly
bent sickle-shape, pointed at one end and containing a notch at
the other, to which a line can be securely tied.</p>

<p>The other hook consists of two pieces of bone of unequal
length. The shorter and thinner piece, about two inches in
length, is pointed at one end and tied at an angle to the bigger
piece, which is about four inches long. The joint at the angle
is strengthened with wild bees’ wax.</p>

<p>A fishing line, made of vegetable fibre twine, is looped once
around the hook, and made secure by tying with another piece
of string, the union being covered with bees’ wax. The line
is held either in the hand or is attached to a long rod. The
hook is baited with grubs. It is by this means that the Barramundi
is caught in large numbers in most of the northern rivers.</p>

<p>A turtle hunt is conducted in King Sound after the following
style: The game is sighted, floating upon the surface of the sea,
either from the mainland or from a craft. Instantly a gesticulative
appeal is made to all to keep quiet. “<i>Hai! Kurdemilla!</i>”
(Look out, a turtle!) “<i>Sh! Sh! Sh!</i>” comes the voice of the
person who has made the discovery, and others repeat it in an
undertone. Everybody who has noticed the turtle bends his
body to escape detection, and beckons to all others to do likewise.
A number of the men then creep to the water’s edge and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
cautiously board a craft (i.e. if the observation was not made
from a craft), in which they carefully paddle towards the prey.
As the boat draws near, the keen eyes of the hunters endeavour
to satisfy their curiosity upon the point as to whether the object
ahead is just one turtle resting upon the surface in the warmth
of a tropical sun, or whether, indeed, there might be a pair,
coupled in the water. The female turtle is much preferred by
the natives on account of the possible nutritious contents of the
ovaries, whose appearance is much like that of a cluster of
yellowish dates. When within reasonable distance of the prey,
two men glide inaudibly over the side of the craft and disappear
from view. Upon a signal, two or three others jump into the
water, apparently disregardless of splash and noise, and swim
towards the now startled game, which lifts its long neck and
looks in the direction of the disturbance. Having perceived the
imminent danger, the turtle at once endeavours to escape from
the peril by ducking under water. But, at the same moment,
it finds its head clasped by one of the men below to be thrust
back above the surface of the water. One of the swimmers has
now reached the turtle, whose shell he promptly seizes by the
collar-like rim at the back of the neck, and pulls it backwards
at the same time as the head is being thrust upwards from
beneath the water. The turtle works its paddles in a frantic
endeavour to escape, but, being held in the sloping position mentioned,
the more its exerts itself, the more persistently it remains
upon the surface, because its paddles are driving it there. If it
be a large turtle, the man who is pulling from behind lifts his
body on to the shell, upon which he sits astride. His weight tends
to further ensure the inclined position of the turtle, which
involuntarily acts as his carrier. The prey is then speedily dispatched
by a blow over the head with a tomahawk or waddy.
There is no doubt the much-criticized De Rougemont must
have witnessed such a scene as here described, and embodied the
inspiration in his narration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>During the season that turtles come ashore, moonlight parties
are arranged which overtake the amphibians as they are clumsily
working their way over the sandy beach. The creatures are
overturned and either slain immediately or are left in their
helpless position over night to be killed in the morning.</p>

<p>Crocodiles (<i>C. porosus et Johnstoni</i>) and dugongs (<i>Halicore
Australis</i>) are located below the surface of water by watching
for bubbles of air, which might rise, or for any little swirls
and disturbances in the water due to the movements of the
creatures below. In the case of the dugong, also known as the
sea-cow, its presence might be betrayed by small nibbled pieces
of sea-weed, which come to the surface when it is feeding. Both
crocodile and dugong are speared or harpooned from the bow
of a raft or canoe. A native often ventures into a water-lily
pool or billabong, known to contain crocodile, prodding the
mud with his spear, as he advances, to feel for the horny skin
of the hidden prey. When one has been located, a large
hunting party wade in a line through the water splashing it
vigorously and shouting loudly to drive the terrified crocodile
from the pool. Once it appears on dry ground, it is chased
and pelted with heavy spears. Natives do not appear to be the
least concerned about their safety when they wade into water
containing crocodiles; in fact, there are few cases known of
natives having been attacked by the reptiles, although occasionally
one finds an individual partially incapacitated or scarred in
consequence of an encounter with a crocodile. The scaly monsters
seem loth to attack a coloured man, but for a white man
to take the risk a native does would mean courting certain
death.</p>

<p>Young crocodiles are caught by hand from the bow of a
canoe whilst cautiously drifting upon them as they are floating
upon or near the surface of the water. The natives explain
that the teeth of the young reptiles have not hardened sufficiently
to do any harm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>Along the north coast, and on the adjacent islands, a regular
watch is kept for the dugong. This peculiar marine mammal
lives in the deep sea, but comes near to the shore to feed. It
might often be observed, especially at high tide, in small, calm
bays and inlets, frolicking at the surface. Full-grown animals
attain a length of twelve feet or more, and weigh up to 1,500
pounds; they are entirely vegetarian, browsing for the most
part on salt-water algae. At intervals it is necessary for the
animal to rise to the surface to breathe. The drawing in of
the air can be heard a great distance off, and is generally,
though erroneously, referred to as the “blowing.” The man
on the look-out watches for the dugong to show itself upon the
surface, and his keen eye can usually detect it, even upon a
slightly rippled water, at some considerable distance out. The
most favourable times are at dusk and on moonlight nights.</p>

<p>When the signal has been given that a dugong is in sight,
the hunters set out in a canoe and cautiously paddle towards the
place at which it was last seen. It may be that long before the
crew reach the particular spot indicated the animal has moved
away, but the trained eye of the observer, who now stands at
the bow of the canoe, is able to follow the movements of the
dugong, even though it be some depth below the surface. At
night the prey is observed on the reflected beam of the moon.
When the game comes up again to take breath, it may be the
canoe is still too far off for action, but the strictest caution is
observed not in any way to cause a disturbance. All men in the
boat remain rigid, and the paddles are held stationary; the man
at the bow, holding his harpoon, poised in readiness above his
head, stands like a statue. The moment the dugong goes below
again, he indicates to the oarsmen with his hand how to steer.
Thus the unsuspecting game is followed around from station
to station until it comes to the surface within throwing distance.
When this occurs, and it may be before the animal actually
reaches the surface, the man in front sends the harpoon forward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
like lightning, with almost infallible precision, to penetrate the
body of the rising dugong and firmly embed itself in it. The
terrified animal plunges forward with a tremendous splash,
tearing the line attached to the harpoon along with it to its
full length. The canoe is pulled along with some velocity
through the water, but the wounded animal soon weakens
through loss of blood and the want of air. It is compelled to
rise to the surface to fill its lungs, but no sooner does it come
near than another missile flies from the hand of the hunter to
also stick in the back of the exasperated animal. Again it shoots
away, with a renewed effort to escape from the cruel harpoon,
but in vain. Before long the want of air again necessitates a
return to the surface, only to be met with a similar treatment
as before. By this time the unfortunate dugong is so much
weakened that it cannot travel far without coming to the
surface frequently; and every time it does another spear is
planted into its body. Before long it caves in; a final swish
with its powerful tail, a quiver throughout the body, and its
helpless carcase is in the hands of the elated hunters. The victorious
shouting or singing of the men in the canoe is echoed
by those watching the hunt on shore, the latter, moreover, in
their excitement usually starting a wild sort of dance on the
sand. A noose is placed round the dugong’s tail, by which it
is towed towards the land. If any resistance is proffered, the
rope is gathered in, and the creature drowned by keeping its
head under water, or one of the hunters suffocates it by
thrusting two of his fingers into its nostrils. This accomplished,
the jaws are tied together to prevent the carcase from water-logging
and sinking.</p>

<p>Often the hunters submerge their canoe, and, by swimming
alongside, pull it under the floating carcase. The water is
then bailed out of the craft and in this way the dugong is
lifted. The hunters then row their prize ashore and drag it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
on to the beach, where it is quartered and cooked. Practically
the whole of it is eaten.</p>

<p>The rich flesh of the dugong is relished by all northern
coastal tribes from the east of Queensland to the west of
Western Australia as far south as the 24th degree of latitude.</p>

<p>The hunters recognize an “old man” dugong by its tusks;
and they assert that often a female is seen carrying its young
upon a fin, suckling it. According to aboriginal information,
a young dugong might also be observed riding on the back of
its mother. A pregnant dugong is considered to make the
richest dish of all.</p>

<p>Occasionally a dugong or a big fish, like a whale, is stranded
during a gale, and this is indeed a red-letter day for the fortunate
tribe upon whose territory the find was made.</p>

<p>Birds of every description are hunted with stone, stick, or
spear. It is astounding how adroitly an aboriginal can project
the light reed spears; to fell a dove at a distance of from forty
to fifty paces is child’s play for an experienced thrower.</p>

<p>There are, however, a number of species which are hunted
in a peculiar way; and these will now be described.</p>

<p>In the northern coastal districts, where hawks are very
plentiful, the natives build small stone covers resembling a
surveyor’s cairn. A hunter conceals himself in one of these
and holds a dove or other small bird, which he has speared or
captured, in his hand above a small loop-hole left at the top
of the structure. He moves it about to attract the attention of
the birds of prey soaring on high. Presently one of the hawks
swoops down upon the dove and grabs it with its claws. But
at the same moment, the hunter drops the dove and with lightning
quickness seizes the legs of the hawk and pulls the bird
under, to quickly kill it. This method is largely practised in
the Victoria River district, there being an abundance of stones
available for the construction of the covers. The occurrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
of many cairns of the type here described has hitherto puzzled
travellers who observed them.</p>

<p>The northern desert tribes of Western Australia adopt a
similar principle, but in place of the stones they use the tussocks
of porcupine grass to cover themselves. In order to attract the
hawks they are hunting, they set fire to one or two plants of
porcupine grass growing close by.</p>

<p>In the same district, and more especially on the Daly and
other rivers in the Northern Territory, wild geese are captured
much after the same principle. Large flocks of these semi-palmated
geese (<i>Anseranus melanoleuca</i>) are in the habit of
visiting one and the same place year after year. The natives
know these places well, and during the absence of the geese
make an excavation in the ground, which they cover with
twigs, pieces of paper-bark, grass, and soil, leaving only one
or two look-out holes. When the birds have returned, a couple
of natives sit in the excavation and watch for the geese to draw
near. As soon as a head or a leg of a goose comes near to an
observation hole, one of the natives seizes the bird, draws it
below, and wrings its neck. In this way many birds may be
bagged without disturbing the flock.</p>

<p>On other occasions the natives climb trees, in which they
build platforms to seat themselves upon and await the arrival
of geese at dusk. The birds come in such large numbers that
dozens are caught at a time; they are simply seized by hand
and killed on the spot. By cleverly imitating the call of the
birds: “<i>nga ngang, ngang-ngang-ngang</i>,” the hunters entice as
many birds as they like to the platform. But even at daytime,
a native often hides in a tussock of grass and imitates the cry
of the bird, which, when it unsuspectingly draws near, is either
grasped with the hand or hit on the head with a stick.</p>

<p>At times the hunter plucks a large water-lily leaf, into which
he cuts two holes for his eyes to look through. Holding this
leaf over his face, he swims out to some geese he has observed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
on a lagoon, and, when within grasping length of the prey, he
simply pulls a bird under by its legs and strangles it.</p>

<p>The note of the whistling duck (<i>Dendrocygna eytoni</i>) is
also accurately reproduced, by which flocks of them are attracted
and killed with a throwing stick while hovering around the
spot which conceals the native. Cockatoos, plovers, and many
other birds are secured in a similar manner.</p>

<p>The flesh of an emu is valued, if for no other reason than
for the size of the carcase and the large amount of grease
which lies beneath the skin. The northern tribes of Western
Australia have discovered a simple means of capturing the big
struthious bird in that they poison a water known to be
frequented by the game. When the bird has quenched its
thirst, it is stupefied to such a degree that it is an easy matter
for the natives, lying in ambush, to overtake it and crack it on
the head. The poison used is supplied by the leaf of <i>Tephrosia
purpurea</i>, which the natives call “<i>moru</i>”; the active principle
is a saponine. In central Australia the pitjuri leaf is largely
used for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The natives also take advantage of the inquisitive nature of
the bird by enticing it into a cul-de-sac or other trap by waving
a conspicuous object, as for instance a corrobboree plume, from
behind a boulder or bush. When the bird is near enough, it is
either rushed with waddies or speared by a number of chosen,
astute men.</p>

<p>The Larrekiya and Wogait tribes conceal themselves in the
branches of a tree, the seeds of which are known to attract the
emu. The hunters ascend the tree in the early hours of the
morning and remain there perfectly quiet until the prey arrives.
At an opportune moment, the bird is speared with a specially
heavy spear known as “<i>nimmerima</i>.”</p>

<p>The south-eastern tribes used to select one or more men, who
would be “dressed up” as emu after the style of the Kukata
men playing emu described on <a href="#Page_81">page 81</a>. In the case of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
hunters, however, a real emu skin is usually employed, with
the head attached and held erect by means of a stick, which
passes through the neck. Very cleverly imitating the strut of
the emu, the men carefully approach their prey, drawing their
spears, which they firmly hold between two toes, along with
them through the grass. Carefully and very slowly encircling
the birds, the hunters gradually work towards the birds, when
presently one or two of them are espied. The moment this
happens, the curious emu rush towards the strangers ruffling
their feathers and emitting peculiar guttural sounds. Now the
critical moment has arrived because the hunters know that,
when their faked plumage is recognized, the birds will decamp.
They stand and lift their spears with their feet. The birds
are now in all probability within throwing distance and very
likely on the point of turning. That is the time selected for
throwing the missile. Having previously selected their mark,
the hunters, with a mighty flourish, let the weapons fly through
the air with almost infallible accuracy. Then sounds the
triumphant whoop; the men, discarding their disguise, rush
towards the wounded victim and promptly put an end to it.
In place of assuming the guise of an emu, the south-eastern
tribes, when in grass-tree (<i>Xanthorrhœa</i>) country, cut the
crown from a spreading tree and carry this as a cover.</p>

<p>The real chase, that is the hunting of larger animals, reptiles,
and birds, is strictly the business of the men, although the
children and women often employ themselves at digging out
lizards, snakes, and the smaller marsupials.</p>

<p>Opossums are driven from their hiding places in the hollows
of trees by smoking them out. A fire is lit at the bottom of a
tree which is known to be hollow, to burn through the enclosing
wall at one side. Then green twigs are thrown upon the flame
to make as much smoke as possible, which works its way
upwards through all the hollows and emerges wherever there is
an opening. The half-stifled animals make for the openings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
and usually drop to the ground; if not they are brought to fall
by spear or throwing stick. Often the greater half of the butt
is thus burned through and the tree crashes to earth. In this
case a diligent search of all the hollows and nooks is made in
order that all things to eat, quite apart from the opossums, may
be bagged.</p>

<p>Often, too, notches are cut into the butt of the tree in step-like

chopping out their prey from the hollows. Whilst some are
thus busying themselves aloft, others are waiting below in

<p>Most of the burrowing marsupials, as well as the dingo and
the imported rabbit, are dug out of the ground. The largest
among these is the wombat, which is nocturnal in habit. The
native knows, moreover, that when the weather is excessively
hot, the animal often comes to the surface and sleeps in front
of its burrow. He therefore stealthily surveys the recognized
haunts of the wombat at such times, and, should he be successful
in locating one, he spears it on the spot.</p>

<p>North of the Great Australian Bight the small wallaby is
captured as follows: The hunter ties a bundle of feathers to
the top of a long pole, up to twenty feet in length, and this he
whirls around his head, high in the air, as he walks across the
tussocky plains known to harbour the game they call “<i>wilpa</i>.”
The wallabies, apparently taking the whizzing feathers to be
an eagle hawk, squat in fear, and, for the moment, do not
attempt to escape from the native. Before the animal recognizes
the fraud, the treacherous spear of the hunter has pinned it
to earth.</p>

<p>The larger species of these marsupials are hunted differently;
they are mostly stalked and killed with the spear. It seems
almost incredible that a native can approach a grazing kangaroo
on a more or less open plain to within spear-throwing distance
without being detected; but such is actually the case. He has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
so perfected his stealthiness that he utilizes every momentary
opportunity, at which the animal’s attention is directed away
from him; and slowly he approaches step by step. His swarthy
colour in itself gives him a natural protection; but more, he
has learned the value of artificially colouring himself with the
earth or mud of the terrain he is about to scout. Thus upon
a “blue mud flat” his body is painted a slaty blue, whilst on a
lateritic soil he applies red ochre or clay. His work is considerably
simplified when the ground contains such features as
ant-hills or dark-coloured boulders, which he can simulate. A
native, when stalking a kangaroo in this way, will always have
his spear poised in readiness to be thrown instantaneously if
need be. Vide <a href="#plate20">Plate XX</a>.</p>

<p>In central as well as northern Australia, hunting parties are
arranged as follows: Several men hide themselves at different
points of a known pad, along which kangaroo are in the habit
of travelling to water or cover. A large party of “beaters,”
consisting of men, women, and children, disperse in the direction
of where kangaroos have been reported to be feeding. On
drawing near to the animals, all members of the beating party
begin to sing and shout. In the Larrekiya tongue this sounds
like “<i>Ye-we o-ho, ye-we o-ho</i>”; in the Arunndta more like
“<i>Yerrewai, yerrewai</i>.” They scamper through the bush until
a kangaroo is actually sighted, when it is pursued amidst the
cries of “<i>Yackäu, yackäu</i>” in the former, and “<i>Yackai</i>” in the
latter tongue. The frightened animal usually makes straight
for the beaten pad, along which it tears at a terrific rate. Upon
hearing the cry of the battue, the men in hiding along the pad
place themselves in readiness; and when the animal leaps by,
the nearest hunter quickly rises and discharges his spear. If
he is successful in felling the animal, he raises a loud, triumphant
shout of “<i>Käu</i>,” as a signal to the driving party, who as
quickly as possible assemble at the spot. Should the spear of
the first thrower miss the kangaroo, the chances are that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
next man, further along the pad, will have a chance of trying
his skill.</p>

<p>A native considers one of the big hind legs to be the most
effective part to wound a kangaroo in, especially if the leg
can be broken. If the animal is hit in any other part of its
body, it will in all probability make off and that will necessitate
perhaps a whole day’s tracking, before it can be overtaken
and killed. If only lightly wounded, the hunters will
experience considerable difficulty in bringing the game to bay;
and the shrewdest strategy might be needed to outwit the
watchful animal. In the latter case the pursuers often split
their company, and, whilst some are attracting the kangaroo’s
attention in the distance, the others endeavour to crawl towards
it under cover, until they are near enough to impart the
death blow.</p>

<p>Whilst pursuing a wounded animal, a native simply flies over
the ground. He cares for no obstacles and seems instinctively
to presage the stability of doubtfully inclined and pivotted
rocks, lying upon hilly slopes or partially concealed among tall
grass. Thus he, with great confidence, jumps from point to
point, with the agility of an antelope, and makes rapid headway,
whereas a white man would hesitate and come to grief.</p>

<p>In the Musgrave, Mann, and Tomkinson Ranges in central
Australia, long brushwood fences are constructed of a more or
less zig-zag shape, the angles of which lie upon beaten pads,
which are known to be used by kangaroos and wallabies living
in the particular area. At each “angle,” the natives dig a large,
deep hole, the mouth of which they cover with thin sticks,
pieces of bark, and subsequently the whole with sand and grass
to give the trap as natural an appearance as possible. So much
completed, a log of timber is placed across the pad, at that side
of the hole, from which the fleeing game is expected to come.
The idea of the log is to make the animal jump over it and
land upon the flimsy cover of the hole on the other side. Quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
frequently an aboriginal places himself in hiding behind the
fence at one of the “angles” and spears the game as it emerges;
in this case the hole is dispensed with.</p>

<p>A kangaroo-hunting expedition often takes a tribe far away
from a main camp, and the party may be absent for two or
three weeks at a time. A native knows that kangaroo follow
the new grass, which appears upon patches recently visited by
a thunder-cloud or, as is the case upon the north coast, by a
bush fire. When either of such phenomena has been chronicled,
and after a short time has lapsed, a party of experienced men
leave the main camp and prospect the ground for game. When
they return, they report the results of their mission to the old
men, and, if favourable, arrangements are immediately made
for the expedition. The best time for the hunt is considered
to be the later afternoon; in the morning and during the heat
of the day, the animals are resting, and the hunter knows that
under those conditions his chances are not nearly so good as
towards evening, when they leave their haunts to feed.</p>

<p>When in 1828 the military settlement at Fort Dundas disbanded,
Sir Gordon Bremer let a number of Timor buffaloes,
which had been used by the residents, roam at large. Since
that time, the animals multiplied to such an extent that large
herds were found by later settlers both on Melville Island and
the mainland opposite. Thousands have been shot by European
hunters, principally for their hides. The natives, too, have
learned to recognize these beasts as an important asset to the
objects of their chase, although, it must be admitted, the flesh
is not relished to anything like the extent of that of the indigenous
game; often, in fact, a buffalo is slain merely for a
slice or two of the flesh, usually the tongue. The cattle of the
European, on the other hand, is eaten with distinct pleasure.
Buffalo are hunted by stalking with the spear. This is not a
task which demands much skill or laborious strategy. The
buffalo spends most of its time out on the plains, more or less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
under cover of the tall, rank grass, which grows up after the
“wet season.” In consequence of this, it is a simple matter
for the native to avail himself of the same cover when approaching
his prey. In nearly every case, the wounded animal
makes off, and the excited hunting gang follow it until it
collapses through loss of blood. It might even be necessary to
throw another spear or two during the chase to finally bring
the beast to fall. The jubilation which takes place during the
final stage of a buffalo-hunt is depicted in the <i>Frontispiece</i> of
this book, an actual scene from life witnessed on Melville
Island.</p>

<p>All along the north coast, a welcome addition to the daily
fare is wild bees’ honey, or as it is now generally called by
the semi-civilized tribes “sugar-bag.” The wild bee establishes
its hive either in a hollow tree or in a crevice in the ground,
and the hunting native—man, woman, or child—is ever on the
look-out for it. When the exit of a hive has been discovered
in the ground, from which numerous bees are flying, the lucky
finder immediately begins to carefully dig down along the
narrow channel until he reaches the honeycomb. If the supply
is limited, it is usually removed in toto by hand and lifted
to his mouth without further ado. If, on the other hand,
there is a goodly amount available, the whole of the comb is
collected and placed in a cooleman or other food-carrier and
taken to camp.</p>

<p>When a hive is located in a hollow tree, the native places
his ear against the butt and listens; by frequently altering the
position of his ear like one undertaking a medical auscultation,
he can gauge the exact position of the hive by the murmur and
buzz beneath the bark. It is then a simple matter for him to
cut into the cover and collect the honeycomb. Some of the
experienced hunters can “smell” their way for a considerable
distance to a wild-bee hive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>The Victoria River tribes have invented an ingenious device,
by means of which they can secure honey from otherwise inaccessible
fissures in rocks or hollows in stout-butted trees. A
long stick is selected, to one end of which is tied a bundle of
vegetable fibre or pounded bark. With the bundle forward,
the stick is poked into the cleft leading to the hive, and, when
the honey-comb is reached, it is turned around and allowed to
absorb some of the honey. Then the stick is quickly removed
and the absorbed honey squeezed from the fibres into a receptacle.
The process is repeated, time after time, until the
greater part of the honey has been obtained.</p>

<p>Wild bee honey is very liquid, but, nevertheless, quite as
sweet and tasty as that of the Ligurian bee. The wild bee,
moreover, possesses no sting, and so offers no serious resistance
to the enthusiasm of the collector. The bee itself is comparatively
small, about the size of an ordinary house fly.</p>

<p>There are no wild bees in central Australia, but in their
stead appears the honey ant (<i>Melophorus inflatus</i>). These
remarkable insects live underground, usually in the red sandy
loams carrying forests of mulga. Throughout the MacDonnell
Ranges, and the country north and south-west of them, and in
the Musgrave Ranges district, they are eagerly looked for by
the local tribes. When the entrance to a nest has been discovered,
a gin at once sets to by inserting a thin stick as a guide
and digging down the course of the hole. This is a somewhat
tedious undertaking, and not infrequently she has to dig to so
great a depth as to completely bury herself. On several occasions
I have unexpectedly come across a woman thus engaged,
and neither was she aware of my coming, nor I of her presence,
until right opposite her. The “honey-ant” itself is a modified
worker of the colony, which is so overfed by the ordinary
workers that its abdomen swells to the size of a marble, about
three-eighths of an inch in diameter, in consequence of the
liquid honey stored within. With the exception of the few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
transverse plates, the abdominal walls are reduced to an extremely
fine membrane, through which the honey can be clearly
seen from outside. The insect’s viscera are compressed into a
small space near the vent. The ant, in this condition, is
naturally unable to move from the spot. It appears that the
inflated ants in this phenomenal way provide for the needs of
the colony during the barren season of the year, acting in the
capacity of living tanks or barrels, which can be tapped as
required.</p>

<p>The gin collects numbers of these ants, as she burrows her
way downwards, and lays them in her cooleman; when the nest
has been ransacked she returns with her prize to camp.</p>

<p>When a native wishes to partake of the honey, he grips one
of the ants by the head, and, placing the swollen abdomen
between his lips, he squeezes the contents into his mouth and
swallows them.</p>

<p>In regard to the taste, the first sensation the palate receives
is a distinct prick of formic acid, which is no doubt due to a
secretion produced by the ant in self-defence. But this is both
slight and momentary; and the instant the membrane bursts,
it is followed by a delicious and rich flavour of pure honey.</p>

<p>The Aluridja and Wongapitcha call this wonderful ant
“<i>winudtharra</i>,” whilst to the Arunndta it is known as
“<i>yerumba</i>.”</p>

<p>In many parts of central Australia the leaves of the red gums
(<i>Eucalyptus rostrata</i>), growing along the river-beds, are covered
with <i>lerp manna</i>—white, conical structures, about the size of a
small lentil, which are secreted by the larvæ of an insect known
as <i>Psylla</i>. On account of their sweetish taste, large quantities
of the cones are collected and eaten. The Arunndta refer to
manna as “<i>prelja</i>.”</p>

<span class="smaller">VEGETABLE DIET</span></h2>

<p>Women collect vegetable products—“<i>Yelka</i>”—“<i>Munyeroo</i>”—“<i>Nardoo</i>”—Water
lily tubers—Native truffle—The “<i>Kaula</i>” or Native Pear—Gall-nuts
of the mulga and bloodwood.</p>

</div>

<p>Whatever contributes towards the vegetable diet of a tribe
is procured essentially by the women. Daily excursions are
made by the women, young and old, collectively or in small
groups, to lay in a stock for the family meal, which is prepared
when the sire returns to camp. The articles which are collected
are almost unlimited in variety, the time of the year usually
determining which kind in particular is made the object of the
day’s outing.</p>

<p>The children accompany their mother, and although they
help in the general collecting, as decided by the mother, they
find many little “luxuries,” like the seeds of the mistletoe and
the nectar contained in the calyx of a flower, which they partake
of as opportunity affords.</p>

<p>Throughout the central and west-central regions, one of the
commonest vegetables, which is eaten in very large quantities,
both raw and roasted, is the tunicated corm of the <i>Cyperus
rotundus</i>, which grows in the sandy banks of practically all the
river-courses in the area mentioned. These little bulbs grow
not very deep below the surface, and, being covered by a comparatively
loose sand or sandy loam, are easily obtained. The
gins use “<i>wanna</i>” or yam-sticks which they mostly hold in the
fist of one hand and apply the chisel-point to the ground like a
pick, whilst the other hand scoops or scratches the sand out of
the hole. As the bulbs come up, they are placed into the bark
carrier (<a href="#plate21">Plate XXI</a>). The best time to dig for the bulbs is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
when the grass-like blades of the plant have dried off. When a
tribe has been camped for a while near a favourable collecting
ground, many acres of soil are turned over, giving one quite the
impression of a cultivated field. The Arunndta call this bulb
“<i>yelka</i>” or “<i>irriakutta</i>,” the Aluridja “<i>dunnmördta</i>.” The bulb
is about the size of a field-pea. To eat it, all that is required to
be done is to rub it between the palms of the two hands and then
blow away the light shell, which peels off during the process.
The natives usually take up five or six at a time and treat
them thus, when they are to be eaten raw; children are especially
fond of them raw. The bulbs have a sweetish, nutty
flavour.</p>

<p>When “<i>yelka</i>” is to be roasted, the bulbs are laid for a short
time on hot ashes, then taken up, rubbed between the hands,
as described above, and eaten.</p>

<p>Of equal importance in this region is a little, fleshy-leaved
plant, resembling a portulaca, which is known generally as
“<i>munyeroo</i>,” and bears the botanic name of <i>Claytonia</i>. It
springs up all over the sandhills of central Australia after a
good rainfall. When on the march, the natives eat the leaves
of this plant raw, both as nourishment and as a thirst-quencher;
at times they are thrown on to hot ashes, and, after baking for
a short time only, eaten hot. But by far the most important
product of the munyeroo is its seed, which occurs as tiny jet-black
grains enclosed within a capsule. Though to us it would
seem most tedious work, it does not take the gins so very long
to collect large quantities of the seed in their bark carriers or
coolemans. Seen in bulk like this, the seed reminds one forcibly
of gunpowder. With sufficient collected for a meal, they return
to camp and clean the seed by “pouring” it from one carrier
to another in the wind, when the dry shells will be blown away.
If there is no wind available, the gin takes up a handful of the
seed, and holding it over a cooleman, blows the husks away
with her mouth. When tolerably clean, the seed is placed, little
by little, upon a flat grinding stone and reduced to a mealy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
consistency with a pebble, which is worked by hand. Every
now and again, a little water may be added to the mass, which,
after a while, is scraped into a cooleman with the side of the
hand. The paste may be eaten raw, but more frequently it is
mixed with more meal to make a dough, and then baked in hot
ashes. The Arunndta call this seed “<i>ingwitega</i>,” the Aluridja
“<i>waketo</i>.”</p>

<p>On the eastern side of the great central region, especially
along the Cooper Creek, the small plant commonly known as
“<i>nardoo</i>” is economically the most important to the local tribes.
Nardoo grows only on clayey flats, on which water has been
stagnant for a while. It is not altogether unlike a small-leaved
shamrock; and its scientific name is <i>Marsilea quadrifolia</i>.
Forming a ring around the stem, just above the surface of the
ground, each plant develops a bunch of spore cases, which, when
matured, are gathered in great numbers by the tribes. Those of
the readers who are familiar with the history of Australian
exploration will recollect that the members of the ill-fated
Burke and Wills expedition were for an appreciable time sustained
by nardoo cakes, which were given them by the Yantowannta
tribe on the Cooper Creek. The spore cases are
flattish-oblong in shape, about the size of a small lentil, and
extremely hard. The natives collect, grind, and prepare nardoo
in precisely the same way as the other tribes mentioned treat
the munyeroo. On account of the extensive use which is made
of the stone hand-mill, in the Cooper Creek district, consisting
of a large flat slab of stone, upon which a pebble is worked to
and fro, the implement has earned for itself the name of nardoo-stone.
The Arunndta refer to nardoo as “<i>parapara</i>,” the Dieri
as “<i>kalumba</i>.”</p>

<p>By the same process the seed of many acacias, which is
collected in considerable quantities, is made into cakes. A
peculiar ingredient is added to the flour by the Victoria Desert
tribes in the form of white ants, which they knead into the
dough and bake with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>On the north coast, from King Sound east to the Gulf of
Carpentaria, quite a variety of grass seeds, also those of the lotus
lily, are ground and baked.</p>

<p>One of the regular articles of vegetable diet in the tropics is
the tuber of the water-lily, which is gathered by the score and
roasted in ashes; it tastes almost like a potato, with perhaps
a distinctive flavour about it resembling that of the Jerusalem
artichoke. In the Northern Kimberleys, the species most
frequently eaten is the beautiful <i>Nymphaea stellata</i>, which is
variously known as “<i>kapa</i>,” “<i>kadje</i>,” or “<i>toki</i>.” But perhaps
the most popular dish in the tuber line in the Northern Territories
is the yam. A great variety of these is available, but it
often requires the genius of an aboriginal to locate them, especially
when there are no leaves showing on the surface. It is
not every yam, however, which is esculent; and some are so
“hot” that even the smallest portion of one applied to the mouth
will severely blister the mucous membranes. Here again the
expert knowledge of the native is of inestimable service to the
inexperienced, for it is he who can at a glance tell which is
fit for consumption and which is not; and it is he who can
treat some of the peppery varieties in such a way as to eliminate
the objectionable taste. Some kinds he discards entirely because
he knows that, if he ate them, they would cause a painful “fire
in the anus.”</p>

<p>Within a somewhat restricted area, extending from north of
the Musgrave Ranges eastwards to the Depôt Sandhills, a
fungus exists, which is known to the Aluridja and Wongapitcha
as “<i>widida</i>,” and to the Arunndta as “<i>oridja</i>.” In
general appearance it is much like the European truffle, and,
like it, grows mostly below the surface of the ground; indeed
it is difficult for the untrained eye to detect a widida, except
under the direction of an aboriginal. At times one finds old
sweetish juice. The inner layer of the shell is white, soft, and
specimens showing above the ground, which have been exposed
by wind or rain, but when this is the case, the fungus is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
really fit for consumption, because its richness will have attracted
many blowflies, and it will, in consequence, be teeming
with maggots. A few specimens of this interesting fungus were
collected by me and submitted to Mr. A. Grant, of Sydney,
who determined it to be a species of <i>Scleroderma</i>. The widida
may be eaten raw, but more commonly they are cooked in
hot ashes.</p>

<p>In the mulga country of the Flinders Ranges, and all over
central Australia, a species known as <i>Marsdenia Leichhardti</i> is
rather common. It is a creeper with slender stalk and smallish,
elongate leaves, and bears a pear-shaped fruit, consisting of a
thin green skin, which encloses a mass of silky seeds. When
broken the plant exudes a thick milky sap. The fruit, stalks,
and leaves of the plant are eaten; they have quite an agreeable,
sweetish taste. The Wongapitcha call the plant “<i>päuya</i>,” the
Arunndta “<i>langu</i>,” whilst in the Flinders Ranges the recognized
name for it is “<i>kaula</i>.” On account of the shape of its fruit,
this plant is referred to by the settlers as “native pear.”</p>

<p>Gall nuts and excrescences, when obtainable, are also on the
daily menu. The most popular is one which is found on the
twigs of the mulga. It is usually referred to by the settlers
as “mulga apple,” and grows up to the size of a walnut. The
whole of the growth, with the exception of a small kernel-like
structure, containing the insect, is edible. The taste, though
slightly eucalyptine, might be compared with that of a “tasteless
apple.” The Wongapitcha call the mulga apple “<i>jarrulge</i>,”
and the Arunndta “<i>takul</i>.”</p>

<p>Another variety of gall nut is found on the smaller branches
of the Bloodwood (<i>Eucalyptus corymbosa</i>), and is, in consequence,
spoken of as the “bloodwood apple.” It is a nodular,
warty, and woody growth, about the size of a billiard ball, the
inside of which is hollow and contains, besides the parasite, a
sweetish juice. The inner layer of the shell is white, soft, and
edible; the whole reminding one of a miniature cocoanut.</p>

<p class="center">Honey solution—Pandanus cider—Human blood.</p>

</div>

<p>Although, naturally, the principal and practically only drink
of the various tribes is water, there are one or two special
beverages deserving of notice. In central Australia, the
Aluridja, Arunndta, and Wongapitcha collect many handfuls
of Eremophila flowers, commonly called honeysuckle by the
local white settlers, in their bark food-carriers, on to which
they pour a quantity of water. The flowers are stirred around
for a while with a stick and then skimmed off with a piece of
bark or by hand. The drink is ready for consumption immediately
after; it has a slightly sweetish taste, and is relished by
young and old. Another source of nectar is the beautiful red
flower of <i>Brachysema Chambersii</i>, which grows in abundance in
the sandhills both north and south of the MacDonnell Ranges
and is known by the Arunndta as “<i>aumba</i>.”</p>

<p>On the north coast of Australia, the wild-bee honey is upon
occasions dissolved in water and drunk. This is nearly always
done when the comb, obtained in the first place, is mixed with
sand and grit, or when the honey is absorbed in the fibres of
the collecting implement described above (<a href="#Page_146">page 146</a>).</p>

<p>The Roper River tribes pick the large fruits of the corkscrew
palm or pandanus, which are not unlike pineapples in
appearance, but very hard and stringy, and, after bashing them
between heavy stones, they keep them immersed in water for
some time before they drink the solution. The water absorbs
the sweetly stringent juice and produces a refreshing toddy. It
being necessary to keep the fruit in water for some time to
extract as much of the palatable ingredient as possible (it may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
be, for that matter, that the natives leave the solution behind
in a cooleman, while they go on a hunting tour, returning for
it in the course of some days’ time), opportunity is given for
the solution to start fermenting; a mild pandanus-cider is the
result. It actually happens that upon great festive occasions,
when large quantities of this beverage have been made some
time beforehand, the natives imbibe more than ordinarily, and
thereby bring themselves into a condition of indubitable merriment.
The Katherine and Victoria River tribes make a similar
beverage, but do not store it for any length of time. This is
the only instance I am aware of where Australian natives,
intentionally or unintentionally, make an intoxicating drink.</p>

<p>When men are on a long-distance stage, as, for instance,
during a drought, when water is scarce and the sun is relentlessly
fierce, they are occasionally obliged to resort to the old
tribal custom of drinking each other’s blood to escape perishing
of thirst. They open a vein in the arm and collect the blood
in a cooleman, or they allow one or more of their companions
to drink straight from the wound. In certain cases of sickness
blood is also given to the patient to drink.</p>

<p>Most of the central Australian tribes have learned to recognize
the narcotic properties of the tobacco-like plant commonly called
pitjuri. All tribes, from the Wongapitcha eastwards to beyond
the borders of Queensland and New South Wales, know the
value of the plant, and even if it does not actually grow in the
particular tribal area, its leaves are obtained from adjoining
tribes by barter. The Dieri, Yantowannta, Wongkanguru, and
Ngameni are all required to procure their supplies from further
north, because the plant does not grow in the Cooper Creek
district. The Arunndta, and latterly the Aluridja as well,
regularly collect as much pitjuri as they want in the valley of
the Finke and other gorges of the MacDonnell Ranges, whilst
the Wongapitcha have their resources in the Musgrave and
Everard Ranges.</p>

<p>The collecting grounds are as a rule owned by a circle of old
men, each of whom clearly defines his boundaries by placing a
number of stones upon the ground. A proprietor may give
another person the necessary permission to gather leaves on his
plot according to certain terms agreed upon. The owner usually
takes a share of the leaves, and, in addition, levies other articles
in exchange for what the collector has removed.</p>

<p>The plant is known by different names among different
tribes; the Arunndta call it “<i>engulba</i>,” the Wongapitcha
“<i>peturr</i>,” and the Aluridja either “<i>mingul</i>” or “<i>warrakinna</i>.”
Scientifically it goes by the name of <i>Duboisia Hopwoodi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>The leaves and stalks of pitjuri are chewed by both men
and women, and in many cases by children also. It cannot be
denied, once a person starts chewing pitjuri, he soon develops
a craving for it, like a habitual smoker does for tobacco. The
usual plan is to partially dry the leaves in the sun, or over
warm ashes, on the spot, and subsequently pack them into
bundles to take home, with the intention of storing them for
future use. But once camp is reached, the future aspect becomes
entirely inconsequential, because so long as pitjuri is known to
be available, the supplies are drawn upon; the result is that the
larder soon becomes depleted.</p>

<p>The men have a way of their own when preparing the
pitjuri. Some of the dried leaves are ground between two stones
and the powder brushed on to a small piece of bark. Then a
few twigs of acacia or eucalypt bark are burned to white ash,
which is mixed with the powder, the whole being subsequently
worked into a softish mass with saliva. Of the final mixture
a quantity is taken and rolled between another dry leaf of the
pitjuri, cigar-fashion; and it is ready for mastication. A plug
of pitjuri does not always remain the property of one individual,
especially when the supplies are running short, but often passes
from one mouth to another, until it has done the necessary
round. When not in use, the plug is secured behind the owner’s
ear, after the style an office clerk carries a pencil.</p>

<p>The natives admit the stimulating benefits they derive from
chewing, or, as they say, “eating,” of pitjuri, both when they
feel off colour or fagged after a strenuous day’s outing. On
the other hand, they look upon pitjuri-chewing in company as
a social comforter, which fosters mirthfulness and friendly
fellow-feeling. When natives meet, even though they be comparative
strangers, an exchange, loan, or presentation of pitjuri
takes place, as a token of friendship. In the same spirit, a
native considers the gift of a stick of tobacco from a European
stranger, who, according to tribal ideas, unlawfully passes over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
the hereditary boundary, as a mere formal obligation, which
expresses the intruder’s peaceable intentions.</p>

<p>The burnt acacia ash, which is added to the powdered leaf
of the pitjuri plant, has a somewhat important function to
perform; and one marvels at Nature having given the unsophisticated
aboriginal the hint to add it. One of the favourite
species, which is burnt for the purpose, is <i>Acacia salicina</i>. A. J.
Higgin has determined by analysis that the ash of this plant
contains the astounding amount of 51.15 per cent. of calcium
sulphate, mixed with a little carbonate of lime. It is the alkali
in this ash which liberates an alkaloid, known as piturine, from
the crushed pitjuri leaves when the two substances meet in the
presence of moisture supplied by the spittle; and this piturine is
much the same in its action as nicotine. An alkaloid is nowadays
manufactured from the leaves of the Australian plant
which is used in medicine as a powerful sedative and hypnotic.
It is not difficult, therefore, to understand why an emu, drinking
from a water poisoned with the leaf of pitjuri, should become
stupefied. Vide <a href="#Page_139">page 139</a>.</p>

<p>Floating log—Log rafts—Paddles—Outfit carried on board—Bark
canoes of different patterns—Used in southern and northern Australia—“Housing”
of canoes—“Dug-outs”—With or without outriggers—Sails.</p>

</div>

<p>We have on several occasions alluded to the fact that the
natives make use of some kind of craft while hunting and
fishing. A few remarks, therefore, upon aboriginal navigation
in general may be appropriate at this juncture.</p>

<p>The simplest type of float is no doubt the log of light timber
used along the north and north-east coast. The straight trunk
of a mangrove is selected, and from it a log is cut, about five
or six feet long, which is stripped of its branches. Where a
river or an estuary has to be crossed, such a log is slipped into
the water and the native lays his body over it, lengthwise, with
his legs straddling it. With his head and shoulders well above
the surface of the water, the swimmer propels himself along
by means of his legs; occasionally he also uses his arms, but
then primarily for steadying his body above the log. The
natives maintain that this method gives them a certain amount
of protection against the attacks of crocodiles, since, when
viewed from below, the man and the log together resemble one
of the reptiles in form. For the same reason the lower thin
end is often left tapering to a point, to simulate the tail of a
crocodile.</p>

<p>When two or three, or more, of these light logs of mangrove
are lashed together, a simple raft results—a type in frequent
use along the eastern shores and rivers of north Australia.
The craft is propelled by either a pole or a paddle, the man
standing in the former case and sitting in the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>The same contrivance is used when a man wishes to cross a
river or a bay, and carry his children or belongings across,
without swamping them. In this case, he usually swims alongside
the raft and propels it by powerful leg-strokes.</p>

<p>In the north-western corner of the Australian continent (i.e.
the King Sound—Glenelg River districts), navigation is undertaken
in large rafts. These are constructed as follows: From
six to ten poles are cut out of the trunks of a tall, straight-growing
mangrove, resembling a pine in shape. The poles are
cut into twelve-foot lengths, and are then trimmed longitudinally,
so that they taper from about one-quarter their length
downwards, like an elongated club; the two ends are pointed
off. In their thickest part, the poles measure about six inches
in diameter. Two of these pieces are now laid upon a level
patch of ground, side by side, with the thick ends all pointing
in the same direction, and “nailed” together with stakes of
hard wood, at various distances along the entire length of the
poles. The remaining poles are linked to the original two in
a similar way; and so a strong platform results, in which the
poles converge in the direction of the thin ends like the arms of
a fan. Another platform is constructed exactly similar to the
one just described. The only tools used in the making of these
structures are tomahawks and large stone and shell scrapers.</p>

<p>All completed, one of the platforms is dragged down the
beach and floated; then the second is taken to the water and
lifted so that it rides upon the former with the converging ends
reversed. The raft is now ready for use (<a href="#plate22">Plate XXII</a>, 2).</p>

<p>Crudely fashioned paddles are used, about six feet long, and
similar to those of the Melville and Bathurst Islanders. The
local name for these is “<i>kanbanna</i>.”</p>

<p>One or two natives usually go out with a raft like this, and
it is astounding with what skill and celerity the clumsy-looking
structure can be handled and paddled along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>The local name for the raft is “<i>kaloa</i>.” The principal use
to which it is put is fishing and turtle-hunting; the mainland
tribes moreover use such rafts for general ferrying, when they
make their periodic visits to the islands included within their
tribal possessions.</p>

<p>One or two cushions of grass or reeds are laid upon the
platform before leaving, to afford dry seating accommodation;
and the hunters never go without taking a fairly solid fire-stick,
which is stuck in an upright position between two poles of the
raft. A few spears and a long harpoon (about ten feet long),
with a barb at the pointed end, are carried, the latter being
secured to the raft by means of a good length of rope. A heavy
boomerang is also added to the outfit, with which the hunters
might kill the spoil when they haul it on deck.</p>

<p>Similar log-rafts are in use on some of the islands in the
Gulf of Carpentaria, but one platform only is constructed, and
the logs are simply lashed together with vines.</p>

<p>Any observant visitor to the River Murray will not fail
even nowadays, when much of the original timber has disappeared,
to observe the numerous trees, growing at or near the
banks, from which large sheets of bark have been removed years
ago by the local natives. The bark was used for making canoes.
Sheets were cut from the eucalyptus trees, measuring from
twelve to twenty feet in length by from three to four feet in
width. These were laid horizontally upon the ground and
moulded into shape while hot ashes were applied to them, the
edges being propped up all round while the bottom was kept
more or less flat. Several stakes were placed crosswise to keep
the sides in position, both at the ends and at the centre. One
end was usually more pointed than the other and slightly more
elevated; this acted as the bow of the canoe. When thoroughly
dry, the craft was launched and carried up to six or seven
passengers. In addition, a small bed of clay was built upon
the bottom, which carried a fire. The canoe was propelled by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
a man, who stood near the stern and either poled or paddled
it along with a long oar.</p>

<p>“It seems almost incredible that a native can approach a grazing kangaroo on a more or less open plain
to within spear-throwing distance....”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A number of different types of canoes are in use on the north
coast, constructed out of one or more pieces of bark. In the
Gulf country, a piece of bark is freshly detached from a tree,
folded along its length, and laid upon the ground in a horizontal
position. The ends are then heated, to render them
pliable, and securely clamped between two upright stakes, and
tied closely together above and below the folded sheet. Stakes
of a length equal to that of the required width of the craft are
next propped from side to side, to give the canoe its shape, and
the ends trimmed on either side with a sharp stone-knife or
fragment of shell. The bottom corners are usually bevelled or
rounded off. The edges are finally held together by sewing
them with strips of cane. Long, thin saplings, stitched along
the inner top edges of both sides, act as gunwales and considerably
strengthen the structure. One or two ties of lawyer
cane are stretched from side to side to prevent the bark from
bulging in the centre. When afloat, a native squats low in the
canoe near the stern and makes good headway by paddling with
a small, oblong piece of bark, first on one side and then on
the other.</p>

<p>In some cases, the bark sides are stiffened by poking flexible
U-shaped hoops under the saplings which form the gunwales;
and in others the sides are kept in position by a number of such
hoops, together with stretchers and ties, without any special
gunwale at all.</p>

<p>The Melville and Bathurst Islanders use large bark canoes
up to nearly twenty feet long, which they construct after the
following principle: A single sheet of bark is cut from either
the woollybutt (<i>Eucalyptus miniata</i>) or the stringybark (<i>E.
tetradonta</i>) by chopping through it circumferentially at two
heights from the ground, the distance between which represents
the required length of the canoe that is to be. Slitting this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
piece once vertically for the whole length, it is removed by
forcing the edge of a chisel-pointed stake under the bark and
levering it off. The outer surface of this piece of bark is rough
and becomes the inside of the canoe. Transverse cuts are made
about two feet from each end, and half the thickness of the
bark removed with a sharp bivalve shell (<i>Cyrena</i>). The ends,
which have by this treatment become pliable, are further
softened by holding them over a fire. The sheet is folded
lengthwise along its middle and clamped at its ends with stakes
rammed vertically into the ground. The bottom corner of the
fold is bevelled off by one or two sloping cuts, along which the
two pieces are sewn together with close, overcast stitches; then
the pieces are stitched together horizontally at the top corner,
for a distance of three or four inches. Thus secured, an
angular or curved piece is cut away from the bark, lying
between the two sewn corners, in imitation of a fish-tail, and
neatly laced together with strips of the lawyer vine. Holes are
previously drilled through the bark with an awl made out of
the leg-bone of a wallaby. The joints are made secure by
plastering them with wild bees’ wax, and the corners are
caulked with plastic clay and fibre or resin. Along the top,
inner edges of the canoe, on both sides, thin, straight poles are
lashed with “run on” stitches. These, however, do not extend
the whole length of the canoe, and, being straight, do not enclose
the stern and bow of the craft. In other respects the structure
is much the same as that in vogue in the Gulf of Carpentaria
country.</p>

<p>When not in use, the canoes are “housed” on a level piece
of ground under the overhanging branches of a banyan or other
shady tree. They are laid in a normal, upright position (not
inverted), and are kept so by short pieces of timber, which are
propped against the sides. The bark thus dries in the required
shape and does not become lopsided. Each canoe has its recognized
place. When a dense growth of mangroves skirts the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
foreshore, a regular approach to the water is kept clear by
cutting away the trees as they grow up. The paddles are laid
within the canoes.</p>

<p>When the occasion demands it, quite a large number of
natives may be carried in a canoe, but usually, when on a simple
turtle or dugong hunting expedition, two persons only man the
craft. The boatmen, while propelling the canoe, squat with
their buttocks resting upon the heels, and with their knees
pressed against the vessel’s sides. The weight of the bodies
being thus well within, the stability of the canoe is considerably
increased.</p>

<p>Although these canoes are mostly used for navigating the
various rivers and estuaries of Melville and Bathurst Islands,
and especially Apsley Straits, occasionally, when wind and
weather are favourable, the natives venture far out to sea, and
not infrequently do they make the journey across to the mainland,
some forty or fifty miles away, where in former days
they carried on a bitter warfare with the Larrekiya and other
tribes.</p>

<p>It is at times imperative that a canoe be attached to a hunting
or warring party, which is travelling overland and later might
want to drift down, or paddle up, a river or inlet to reach its
destination. Under such circumstances, six or eight men carry
the craft upon their shoulders as they walk alternately left and
right of it.</p>

<p>Paddles are made of hard wood, having a single, well-shaped
blade and a rounded handle. The edges of the blade are
parallel, or taper slightly towards the end, which is either
square or rounded. They are from three to five feet in length.
When rowing, the natives clasp the handle with both hands and
dip the blade on one side or the other, just as the steering
requires it.</p>

<p>Certain north-eastern tribes of Queensland used to make
their canoes of two or three sheets of bark. In the first instance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
the sheets would be stitched along the keel, and in the second
a lenticular or oval piece was inserted, which acted as a flat
bottom.</p>

<p>Dug-outs are found all along the north coast, but it is very
probable that they are of foreign origin, presumably Melanesian
or Polynesian. A suitable tree having been felled, its ends are
shaped and the inside chopped, gouged, and burned out, so that
only the outer walls remain. Some very big boats of this description
were seen in use among the Larrekiya, and their seaworthiness
was proved time after time.</p>

<p>Some of the Queensland tribes attach one or two outriggers
to their canoes, which, of course, give them additional safety
when by chance they might be overtaken by a rough or choppy
sea.</p>

<p>The Groote Islanders in the Gulf of Carpentaria carry a
mast in the centre of their dug-outs, to which they lash two
long horizontal bamboo-booms and spread a sail between them.
This circumstance is remarkable, since the Groote Islanders are
among the least known of the Australian tribes and have come
less into contact with Europeans than other tribes who might
have learned the use of sails.</p>

</div>

<p>Although under ordinary circumstances the aboriginal of
Australia is a peaceable, placid individual, who prefers to
talk of what he could do to his enemy rather than look for
trouble in a hostile camp, yet, being human, there are naturally
extenuating circumstances, which might thrust the obligation
upon his shoulders to pick up arms and fight for the sake of
his individual honour or of his tribe’s safety. In the former
case a duel is arranged, in the latter a regular warfare is
waged, which might last a day or continue, off and on, for
years at a time.</p>

<p>Duels are perhaps more frequently fought among the women
than the men, the cause in most cases being trivial. A common
disturbance of the peace is brought on by petty theft. One
woman might, intentionally or otherwise, appropriate a small
article belonging to another. When the article is missed by
the owner, an argument ensues, which soon warms up to a
strained pitch of excitement. Abusive epitaphs become prolific,
which repeatedly embody references to excrement and other
filth. Eventually the irate hags can constrain themselves no
longer and each produces her fighting stick, known throughout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
central and northern Australia as “<i>kutturu</i>.” Walking towards
each other, and all the time striking the ground in front of
them, from left to right, and from right to left, the women
continue their vilification. In the Arunndta tongue this is
something after the following style: “<i>Uttnarranduddi, uttnatikkia,
atutnia, arrelinjerrai!</i>”</p>

<p>The ground is struck with the heavy sticks immediately in
front of the opponent’s feet, so vigorously that dust and dirt
fly into the air. It is not long before the foot of one of the
gins is struck; and then the fight begins. The gin that was hit
immediately lifts her kutturu and aims a blow at the head
of the offender. But the latter in all probability will have been
prepared to ward off the blow.</p>

<p>The kutturu consists of a heavy “ironwood” stick, on an
average about three feet long and of circular section; it is
bluntly pointed at each end and usually has a carved decoration
upon its surface. The parrying party holds the stick with
its pointed ends between her palms, and, by moving or swaying
it from side to side in an inclined position, diverts the force of
the impact from her head. The duellists take it turn about to
strike and parry. The head is the principal mark, but it is
not against the rules to aim at the fingers. When the latter
are struck, it not infrequently happens that one or two of them
are broken.</p>

<p>If the antagonist is too clever at warding off a blow, a gin
might occasionally alter her tactics and try to stab the head
opposite her with the point of the kutturu. If the attempt
proves successful, a very deep gash often results, followed by a
prolific flow of blood. The damaged gin wails aloud and drops
her kutturu whilst she catches the blood, which is pouring from
her wound, in the hollow of her hand and throws it in the
other’s face.</p>

<p>The triumphant assailant does not take a mean advantage of
her “score,” but replies to the blood-slinging by rushing to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
nearest fire, from which she scoops a double handful of hot
ashes to throw at the lamenting one. This is by no means the
end of the trouble, but really incenses the combatants to more
desperate action.</p>

<p>So soon as the wounded gin has overcome the shock, she
plucks fresh courage and again takes up the argument with her
kutturu. The fight continues until one of the gins receives a
blow on the head severe enough to disable her, or until both
have kept the strife going to a stage of complete exhaustion.</p>

<p>When a gin has been disabled, and lies more or less in an
unconscious condition upon the ground, the victor stands over
her, triumphantly swinging her kutturu, whilst her tongue
dispels the hatred by talking incessantly without opposition.</p>

<p>During the whole time of this heated altercation, the camp
has been generally disorganized. Other women are vociferating
wildly, children are screaming, a few score dogs yelping, and
the men are sitting around quietly and gloomily, with their
eyes turned from the scene of the duel, and only occasionally
exchanging a few words in a subdued whisper.</p>

<p>The method the men adopt for settling their disputes among
themselves is not unlike that of the women, but more systematic.
They place themselves face to face upon a clear piece of ground,
with their kutturus in their hands, and about half a chain apart.
After the customary abusive preliminaries, the psychological
moment arrives, when one man rushes at the other carrying
his weapon in both hands behind his back, and, as he runs,
preparing for a monstrous blow. When he reaches to within
striking distance of his opponent, he pulls up short, and, with
the momentum created by his run behind him, deals an awful
whack. But the other man has placed himself in the defensive
attitude, and, as the weapon falls, he springs forwards and
upwards to parry the blow destined to crash upon his skull.
The striker now retraces his steps and prepares to receive the
onslaught from the opposite side. This procedure of alternate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
attack and defence continues until one of the men falls or both
combatants are thoroughly exhausted. All through the fight,
however, there is a wonderful display of power, agility, and
chivalry, the figures of both the striker and receiver being conspicuously
graceful in their movements (<a href="#plate13">Plate XIII</a>, 2).</p>

<p>Where the boomerang is known it, too, is extensively used,
in conjunction with the shield, by duellists to settle minor
altercations. The offended party throws one of his missiles
into the camp of his rival as a summons to the fight, whereupon
the latter immediately responds by throwing another back, and
walks out into the open, carrying with him a single boomerang
and a shield. Both men now start a war-dance, during which
they gradually approach each other, lifting their legs high in
the knees, brandishing their boomerangs in the air, and holding
their shields in front of their bodies. After a while, they close
in; and the real fight begins. Whenever an uncovered spot
presents itself on either man, the opponent, with the quickness
of lightning, attempts to strike it with his weapon. The hands
in particular are selected as the best marks to quickly put the
rival out of action; and this opportunity is never missed when
it presents itself to the quick eye of the native.</p>

<p>Waddies and clubs of various forms are used all over Australia,
both with and without shields, to decide the rights or
wrongs of individual grievances.</p>

<p>There is no hard and fast line of demarcation between a
waddy or fighting-stick and a club. The original conception of
either is a short stick or truncheon, which is used both for
beating and throwing.</p>

<p>The commonest form is a cylindrical rod of hard wood with
a smooth or vertically grooved exterior and rounded ends. It
is either straight or curved.</p>

<p>The Bathurst Islanders have a type similar to the above, but
with a slightly swollen distal end. The stick often carries a
sharp spike, which projects from the same end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>The largest fighting-sticks are to be seen in the Forrest River
district in the far north-western district of Western Australia,
measuring up to four and a half feet in length. The stick
tapers from the top towards the handle end, and has a flat face
at either extremity. A gripping surface is made by roughly
incising the thinner end all round for a distance of four or
five inches.</p>

<p>A peculiar combination of implement with weapon was used
by the women of the lower River Murray tribes. It consisted
of a stick with a blade at one end and a knob at the other, the
one moiety serving as a digging stick, the other as a club.</p>

<p>Along the Cooper Creek, a large, stout baton of mulga, with
a globate knob at the handle end, was used by the Wongkanguru,
Yantowannta, and other tribes.</p>

<p>Some very shapely clubs belonged to the Narrinyerri. They
were made of casuarina wood, and had a heavy, inflated head,
which was usually pointed off at the top. The handle was
moderately thin and had a number of circular grooves cut near
its end to prevent the hand from slipping when the wood was
wielded. Further west, on the Nullarbor Plains, the thick end
was not pointed off, but, on the contrary, was perceptibly flattened.
In both types mentioned, the surface was well smoothed
and polished, although the clubs of the coastal tribes along the
Great Australian Bight were generally longitudinally grooved.</p>

<p>A rather fanciful form of club, reminding one of the medieval
spiked clubs, was found in the possession of the fast disappearing
Yantowannta tribe at Innamincka. A stick, nearly two feet
six inches long, and circular in section, had an enlargement
near the head-end, which was deeply grooved vertically and,
in the upper portion, circumferentially also, the intersection of
the grooves producing a number of pointed prominences.</p>

<p>Used in conjunction with a heavy three-sided shield, the
south-eastern tribes of South Australia fought most of their
duels with a dangerous type of waddy, some two feet or more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
long, which had an attenuated knob at the handle end and a
flat, angular projection at the opposite end; the latter was sharp
and pointed. The weapon was known as “<i>lionila</i>,” and, from
our point of view, might be classed as a battle axe.</p>

<p>In the Roebuck Bay district, a flat, hard-wood club is found,
the sides of which are straight and slightly tapering towards the
handle end; the edges being rounded off. One of the flat sides
is usually ornamented with an engraved geometrical pattern.</p>

<p>The Larrekiya and Wogait construct a flat throwing weapon,
not unlike a small cricket bat in shape, from six to twelve inches
long, which they call “<i>damatba</i>.” It has a short handle and
very sharp edges, and, being hurled at an enemy edgewise, it
flies through the air with a revolving motion. If any part of
the native’s naked body is struck with this weapon, a very deep
wound is always inflicted, from the effects of which the unfortunate
victim might easily bleed to death.</p>

<p>Under the category of fighting-sticks we might also mention
the wooden swords, of which some form or other is known all
over the continent.</p>

<p>In its normal form, the sword is a long and narrow, lanceolate
blade of hard and heavy wood, up to five feet in length.
The sides are convex, and the edges fairly sharp. The surfaces
are either smooth or longitudinally grooved, and in addition
decorated with finely incised patterns of different descriptions.
These swords are much used by the Minning tribe of the Eucla
district.</p>

<p>The Cooper Creek tribes make the weapon with a slight
curve in it, like a boomerang, the length being about the same
as in the previous type. Among the Dieri it goes by the name
of “<i>marriwirri</i>.” The Arunndta and Aluridja forms are not
made so long, but slightly wider, and of very heavy mulga wood.</p>

<p>In the northern coastal districts, the type is different in so
far as it tapers towards that end, which is to serve as the
handle, and terminates there in a flat or slightly concave base.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
The haft is not infrequently bound round with vegetable fibre,
and subsequently covered with beeswax, to prevent the hands
from slipping.</p>

<p>These weapons are all used with two hands for striking and
parrying blows during a duel. When about to “receive” a
blow, the native takes the precaution to keep his elbows close
against his body to avoid the risk of having his arm broken by
the ricochet of the heavy weapon. A favourite mark is the
opponent’s hands; and the fighter has to carefully guard them
by adroitly and instantly shifting the sword sideways the
moment he perceives that the blow has been aimed at them.</p>

<p>The northern and north-western tribes use light reed spears
when settling quarrels between two individuals. The spear is
about five feet long and has a tapering head of mangrove wood,
which is inserted into the top end of the reed shaft. All coastal
tribes, from the Adelaide River westwards to the Ord River,
use this spear, but it is not known in central Australia. The
opponents, standing about forty or fifty feet apart, throw the
weapons at each other with wonderful precision, but before the
dangerous little missile can reach its mark, the would-be recipient
dodges it with equal skill. A number of such spears is
carried by each combatant. Whilst the duel is proceeding, the
two natives dance in defiance to taunt the rival, grotesquely
jumping from one foot to the other, holding the arms semi-erect
and bent at the elbows and wrists, whilst the body is
thrown forward and the head kept back. When a spear passes
very near to or grazes its mark, the native greets his escape
with a short but strangely articulated exclamation sounding like
“<i>irr</i>.” The throwers are constantly on the move, and, whenever
possible, one stoops to pick up a new spear from a bundle
of them lying at his side. The little missiles are so light that,
when they hit the ground, they skip along the surface and can
be recovered uninjured. Although these spears seem more like
toys than weapons, they are nevertheless most formidable on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
account of their sharp point and the velocity with which they
travel.</p>

<p>A method which is in vogue among the central Australian
tribes, like the Arunndta and Dieri, is the dagger duel. The
dagger employed is a long stone-knife with a grip or haft of
porcupine resin; the Arunndta name for it is “<i>putta ildurra</i>.”
The combatants hold one of such daggers in one hand and a
light shield of kurrajong wood in the other, and thus equipped
they approach each other. After some preliminaries in the way
of dancing and an accompaniment of excited shrieking, the men
close in upon one another. With the shield they not only catch
the well-directed stabs before any bodily injury is done, but they
also thrust the opponent back to keep him at arm’s length. It
is not an uncommon event for such a duel to be fought for a
considerable time without any bloodshed, the skilful parrying
checking many a fatal blow until eventually utter exhaustion
appeases the thirst for revenge and soothes the hatred, which
was only too evident at the beginning of the duel. At other
times severe gashes are inflicted, which occasionally terminate
fatally. Vide <a href="#figure04">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>The most serious of all duels is undoubtedly that in which
the heavy spear is used. The method is similar to that of the
light spear fights, with the distinction that those engaged in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
strife stand further apart, and do not run the same amount of
risk by exposing themselves to the same extent as in the former
case. It is recognized that a “hit” by one of the large heavy-bladed
spears will result in a dangerous wound, and, therefore,
the men face the ordeal in all conscientiousness, knowing that
if they can prove themselves equal to their opponent’s dexterity
for a reasonable length of time, the moment will arrive when
the strife might be terminated by arbitration. One occasionally
meets with a person who has a broken portion of a spear-head
deeply embedded in the musculature of his thigh or other region
of his body, where a violent inflammation around the lesion has
caused the sufferer much pain because he has not been able to
extract the offending piece of wood or stone from the tissue.</p>

</figure>

<p>In the Balmaningarra district of the northern Kimberleys of
Western Australia, the warriors hold the shield (which they
call “<i>karwinnunga</i>”) in their left hand, but, if necessity arises,
they quickly change it to the right. As a spear whizzes by
harmlessly, or is skilfully warded off, the defendant sounds a
short triumphant “<i>p-r-r-r</i>” with protruding and vibrating lips.
When about to “receive” a missile, the native stands in much
the same attitude as that adopted by a modern rapier-duellist.
The moment, however, he realizes that his antagonist’s aim has
been inaccurate, or he has been successful in dodging or warding
off the death-bringing stick, he balances himself on one leg, cocks
the other under his buttocks, and defiantly throws his arms
above his head, jeering at his enemy and inviting him to throw
once more, crying: “Look! I am defenceless, and I am exposing
my body to you! I have no fear of you; your spears can only
scratch the ground as the yam-stick of a woman digging for
grubs!”</p>

<p>Barely has he finished his taunting sentence, and before the
other man has had time to prepare for another throw, he bounds
forward and projects his weapon. During the fight, the antics
of the men, especially of the one on the defensive, are remarkable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
jumping from leg to leg, at one time holding the shield
straight in front of the body whilst covering the head, at
another, standing erect with the shield at about the level of
his chest.</p>

<p>During their duels, an admirable spirit of chivalry is displayed
by the combatants. If, for instance, a shield breaks, the
man who has the advantage refuses to fight until the broken
weapon has been replaced. The same regulation applies to a
broken spear, but not to a broken spear-head; if the latter
breaks, the circumstance is looked upon as the result of bad
workmanship, and the fight continues. Only a certain number
of spears is carried by the parties; and any damaged weapon
might be replaced from a bundle held in reserve by the gins,
who stand in readiness. When the missiles have been spent on
both sides, the parties change ends to collect their spears, after
which the hostilities are resumed.</p>

<p>Irrespective of any of the methods here described, whereby
the natives actually fight with weapons for the sake of honour
or revenge, it is quite as customary among all Australian tribes
to bring about the downfall of a rival or enemy by the magic
influence of suggestion. This is the wonderfully potent method
of “pointing” death at a man, who may or may not be present
or visible. The process is usually referred to as “pointing the
bone,” or simply “boning.”</p>

<p>In the Alligator district of the Northern Territory, the
excrement of a man, who is to be sent to his death, is collected
and roasted over a fire; after which a little of it is taken and
mixed with the resin of porcupine grass. A ceremonial dance
follows during the night, which is of a very secret character,
men as well as women participating. The chants which are
sung implore the birds of night—the owl, the plover, and the
curlew—not to betray the men who are seeking revenge. At
the far end of the ground, cleared for the occasion, a hole is
dug, in which a fire is burned while the ceremony is in progress.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
Enchanting songs are now rendered, which are to entice the
spirit-father of the doomed man to attend. A little later one of
the principal performers marches forwards, carrying a small
ball of resin mixed with the burned excrement, together with a
short stick representing the spirit-father. At a given moment,
he begins to dance and, with his free hand, catches hold of his
scrotum. When he arrives at the hole, in which the fire is
burning, other men snatch the glowing embers and clear the
ashes out of the way. The dancer throws the resin-ball containing
the excrement into the hole and covers it with hot sand.
The moment it strikes the hot ground, the resin fizzles and
crackles; and those sounds are taken to be the voice of the
spirit calling the victim from the earth.</p>

<p>Shortly after the ceremony these facts are made known to
the unfortunate who has been selected to die; they are usually
conveyed to him by one or two eye-witnesses of the ceremony.
Overcome with consternation and terror, the fellow immediately
begins to fret; and death will inevitably be the outcome,
unless the counter-influence of a medicine man or other
tribal power can make itself felt beforehand.</p>

<p>Upon other occasions in the same district, the footprint of
a man, who has been decreed to die, might be found upon a
clay-flat or a river bank. The track must be intact; if it be in
the least degree imperfect, it is considered useless for the purpose.
Taking for granted, then, that it is clear and well-defined,
the mould is cut out of the clay in toto and buried in
an anthill. There it is secreted until such time as the spirit
of the doomed man’s father is supposed to be in attendance at
a tribal ceremonial, when it is fetched and broken over a blazing
fire. This act answers the same purpose as the burning of the
resin and excrement in the previous case.</p>

<p>An old Arunndta custom was to “cut the shadow” of a man,
who was to die, with a sharpened mussel-shell knife called
“<i>langa langa</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>When a man of the Worora tribe dies, his relatives resolve
to avenge his death, which they suppose was the work of an
enemy, whom they name. During the obsequies, a bone is
taken from the arm of the deceased, usually the humerus, but
occasionally the radius, and small portions cut or scraped off it,
to be handed to the nearest of kin, who officiate as the avenging
party. The little group sit facing the direction in which the
supposed murderer is seen, or at any rate is known to be
residing. Together they place some of the pieces of their
relative’s bone, which they call “<i>gibba</i>,” into their mouths, and,
after chewing them for a while, they spit the pulp towards
their victim, at the same moment naming him as the perpetrator
of the deed—the cause of their bereavement. The Sunday
Islanders adopt a similar method, but refer to the bone as
“<i>käu-käu</i>”.</p>

<p>Most of the tribes are in possession of differently shaped
sticks and bones, with which the death-pointing is done. These
are usually about three or four inches long, pointed at one or
both ends, and containing a small bleb of resin at one end, to
which a piece of human hair-string is attached. When the
instrument is of bone, it is usually a piece of the dead man’s
skeleton. The Aluridja take the fibula of the man whose death
is to be avenged, and construct a flattish “bone,” pointed off at
both ends. The Arunndta select the same bone, or the ulna,
which they scrape down to a long tapering point at one end;
to the opposite extremity they attach a little porcupine resin.
Occasionally one finds these objects carried in hollow bone or
bark-receptacles. Another common form of the Arunndta is a
short stick, at either end of which a blunt arrow head knob
is carved, round one of which a long piece of human hair-string
is tied. A simple punctate design is at times burned into the
stick. Some of the southern tribes of the Northern Territory
have pointing stones, which are shaped much like a stone-knife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
hafted with porcupine resin and suspended by a long piece of
human hair-string.</p>

<p>A number of such pointing instruments are constantly carried
about by certain men of the tribe, whilst others are kept buried
in places only known to a few. Often a stick is constructed
just when the occasion requires one, and when there happens
to be none available.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp95" id="plate23" style="max-width: 43.75em;">

<p>“One man cowers upon the ground ... whilst the second, kneeling at the

</figure>

<p>Any fully initiated men may make use of a pointing-bone or
stick, but when the grievance concerns the tribe in general, the
operation is performed by the magician or medicine man.
Women do not generally carry these sticks, but the Aluridja,
and no doubt others also, allow their gins to charm their yam-sticks,
with which they then “kill” their antagonists. A
charmed yam-stick is believed to paralyse the arms of any
person, whom it touches, when appealed to by the owner; consequently
one of this kind is chosen for duelling whenever
possible.</p>

<p>When a man has been condemned to death, the person or
persons, who are to administer the fatal charm, are nominated.
The “pointing” apparatus are produced, and with them the
men take up a kneeling position a little distance away from
the camp. Facing the doomed man’s habitation, they lift the
bone, or stick, to shoulder height and point it at the victim.
The long piece of hair-string, which is attached to the instrument,
is tightly tied around the charmer’s arm, above the elbow.
This is done to endow his system with the magic influence of
the pointing-stick he is holding; and that magic, he believes,
passes into the destructive words, which he is uttering: “May
your skeleton become saturated with the foulness of my stick,
so that your flesh will rot and its stench attract the grubs,
which live in the ground, to come and devour it. May your
bones turn to water and soak into the sand, so that your spirit
may never know your whereabouts. May the wind shrivel your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
skin like a leaf before a fire, and your blood dry up like the
mud in a clay-pan.”</p>

<p>There is a great number of different methods employed in
administering the fatal charm of the pointing-stick, all of which,
however, are after much the same principle. A common
practice amongst the Aluridja is for the man, about to use the
stick, to leave the camp and seclude himself behind a tree or
other obstacle. He squats upon the heel of one foot which he
has tucked under his body. He points the bone or stick straight
at the man who is to die, or, it may be, merely in the direction
he imagines he would strike him. Whilst administering the
curse, he holds the object in the hand of his outstretched right
arm.</p>

<p>Both the Arunndta and Aluridja often work in pairs after
the following style: One man cowers upon the ground, with
or without his pointing-stick in his hand, whilst the second,
kneeling at the side of him, holds his pointing-stick at arm’s
length over the former man’s back, and directs it towards the
person who is about to receive the evil charm. Vide <a href="#plate23">Plate
XXIII</a>.</p>

<p>To make their charm more effective, and the death-penalty
more certain, central Australian tribes not uncommonly tie
the claws of a bird of prey, the eagle-hawk by preference, to
the pointing instrument. It is believed that by this trick the
evil magic works like the grip of a bird, by clutching the
doomed one’s chest and crushing it. If by accident the
unfortunate fellow becomes cognizant of this, and it happens
that, as actually is frequently the case after a big feast, he
suffers from indigestion, he naturally interprets the symptoms
of his indisposition as being due to the invisible, tightening
girth, which the charm has laid about him. The fatal termination
arrives at a much earlier date in consequence.</p>

<p>A man who discovers that he is being boned by an enemy is,
indeed, a pitiable sight. He stands aghast, with his eyes staring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
at the treacherous pointer, and with his hands lifted as though to
ward off the lethal medium, which he imagines is pouring into
his body (<a href="#plate24">Plate XXIV</a>). His cheeks blanch and his eyes become
glassy, and the expression of his face becomes horribly distorted,
like that of one stricken with palsy. He attempts to shriek, but
usually the sound chokes in his throat, and all one might see
is froth at his mouth. His body begins to tremble and the
muscles twitch involuntarily. He sways backwards and falls
to the ground, and for a short time appears to be in a swoon;
but soon after he begins to writhe as if in mortal agony, and,
covering his face with his hands, begin to moan. After a
while he becomes more composed and crawls to his wurley.
From this time onwards he sickens and frets, refusing to eat,
and keeping aloof from the daily affairs of the tribe. Unless
help is forthcoming in the shape of a counter-charm, administered
by the hands of the “<i>Nangarri</i>” or medicine-man, his
death is only a matter of a comparatively short time. If the
coming of the medicine-man is opportune, he might be saved.</p>

<p>The medicine-man of Australian tribes is not so much an
individual who has the knowledge of medicinal values of herbs
and of surgical practices as one who is the recognized sorcerer,
capable of rebuking the ills wrought by an enemy or evil spirit
(<a href="#plate08">Plate VIII</a>). He attains his distinction either by heredity or
by accidental, but maybe exemplary, craftiness. In the former
case, he is looked upon as a favoured son, who has inherited from
his tribal and ancestral fathers the magic art of neutralizing the
evil charm of a spirit or enemy, which manifests itself in prostration
or disease; at the same time he is the official power of
the community, who alone can outwit the evil spirit, control
the elements, and keep pestilence away from the camp. This
hereditary art is recognized as a concrete matter, which is
believed to have been deposited within the body of the particular
individual by spirit-ancestors or nearer spirit-relations; this
matter might have taken the form of a special variety of wood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
small bones of animal or man, and a number of sacred stones,
all of which the made medicine-man carries about with him in
his abdomen, more or less replacing the ordinary entrails
originally occupying the cavity. Each tribe has a number of
these medicine-men, whose rank is gauged according to age and
the principle they have lived up to. For instance, in the qualification
of the early medicine-men of the Adelaide tribe, it was
deemed necessary that the candidate should taste human flesh
at least once is his life. In the central Australian tribes a
medicine-man should not eat of kangaroo which has been
feeding upon new green grass; if he does, some of his mystic
powers will leak out of his body, and he will immediately drop
in the estimation of his tribal admirers. If the offence is
repeated a number of times, he is disrespected entirely as a
professional sorcerer. There are, of course, a great number of
restrictions, which the conscientious practitioner observes most
punctiliously.</p>

<p>Every medicine-man of any standing at all has his own
history of qualification, which he does not hesitate to make
known to the public at opportune moments. Old Kai Kai,
the leading Nangarri of the western Arunndta on the Finke
River, relates how he, as a young hunter, became detached
from the rest of the party, and, after tracking a wounded
kangaroo for a whole day, he eventually abandoned the pursuit
to make for a rock-hole in the stony James Ranges. It was
nigh on sunset when he arrived at the hole, tired and thirsty.
He threw his wommera and spears upon the ground, and
eagerly lay over the cool fluid to still his parching thirst. But
when he sipped the water a tadpole entered his mouth, and,
before he could spit it out, it slipped down his gullet and
dropped into his abdominal cavity with a bump that caused
him much pain. When he recovered, he again tried to soothe
his burning lips, but met with a similar fate. Several times
more he tried, but in vain; as soon as his burning lips touched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the surface of the water, a slimy tadpole slipped into his mouth
and fell into his stomach with a painful thud. In desperation
he made a final attempt to carefully approach the water’s level,
when he beheld what he took to be the image of his face and
body reflected from below. Horror overcame him, however,
for the image was that of another man! And, as he looked
again, he noticed that the body of the image was transparent,
and inside of it there were just as many rounded pebbles as
he had swallowed tadpoles! He collapsed at the side of the
waterhole and slept like a dead man, for how long he could not
say. When at length he woke up, he found himself among the
reeds of the flowing sheet of water on the Finke River, which
the white people call Running Waters. He now quenched his
thirst. And when the recollections of his experience at the
rock-hole came back to him, he realized that the man who had
looked at him through the water had been a spirit, and he
could still feel the pebbles he had placed inside of him. Now
it was obvious to him that he had been ordained a Nangarri,
and he returned to his camp, where his relatives were anxiously
awaiting him.</p>

<p>Having been called to the side of a “boned” patient, the
Nangarri allows a number of the relatives to be present when
he applies his weird method of treatment. At first he cuts
some ridiculous antics, during which he mumbles or chants
some almost inaudible verses. The patient is, in the meantime,
laid flat on the ground. The Nangarri approaches the sufferer
from the foot end and, throwing himself upon the ground,
crawls right on to the chest of the former, biting the skin of
his patient at several places as he crawls on to the body.
Having “located” the seat of the trouble, the “doctor” slips on
to the ground, and, picking up a fold of the skin with the
underlying fatty tissue between his fingers over the vital spot,
applies his lips, and, perhaps, his teeth, too, to it. He sucks,
bites, and kneads the skin, frequently lifting his head and spitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
blood on to the ground. The patient is all the while
groaning with pain; if he becomes unmanageable, he is called
to order by the Nangarri. At length the climax arrives. The
Nangarri withdraws from the patient, his cheeks visibly
inflated, and, conscious of the expectant eyes of all present, he
empties the contents of his mouth into his hands, which he holds
like a receptacle in front of him. The fluid, consisting of
saliva and blood, is allowed to trickle to the ground or into the
fire. Then a triumphant chuckle announces that the malignant
element has been discovered! With feigned exaltation, the
great healer steps towards the awe-stricken relatives, holding
between the index-finger and thumb of his right hand an article,
such as a small stick, a bone, a pebble, a meteoric bomb, or a
talon, which he avows is the cause of the “boned” man’s affliction,
and, having now been skillfully and permanently removed,
the unhappy fellow has nothing more to tear.</p>

<p>The good news is immediately conveyed to the prostrate form
on the ground. The effect is astounding. The miserable
fellow, until that moment well on the road to death, raises his
head to gaze in wonderment upon the object held by the Nangarri,
which, in all seriousness, he imagines has been extracted
from the inside of his body. Satisfied with its reality, he even
lifts himself into a sitting position and calls for some water to
drink. The crisis has now been passed, and the patient’s
recovery is speedy and complete. Without the Nangarri’s
interception, the “boned” fellow would have fretted himself
to death for a certainty, but the sight of a concrete object,
claimed by the recognized authority of the tribe to be the cause
of the complaint, signifies recovery to him, and with its removal
comes a new lease of life. The implicit faith a native cherishes
in the magic powers of his tribal medicine-man results in cures,
which exceed anything recorded by the faith-healing disciples
of more cultured communities.</p>

<p>Aboriginal warfare might be divided into two classes,
according to whether it is of the nature of a true and bloody
inter-tribal fight, or of a feud arising between two tribal groups
or parties. In any case, the hostilities might be of long standing
and the enmity might have existed for generations past. The
<i>casus belli</i> is as multifarious as are those of modern peoples. It
might be on account of a natural treasure held by one tribe,
such as a valuable ochre-deposit, which is coveted by another.
Or it might be simply the result of an elopement or an abduction
as between two groups or families belonging to different
tribes. The cause frequently determines the method to be
adopted during the fight.</p>

<p>When the arch-foe is to be faced, nothing is out of order
in strategy, provided the plan is effective, and, above all things,
as gruesome as possible. The main objective to be achieved is
to make an assault as murderous as circumstances will permit,
and to establish a record massacre, in order that the enemy
might be thoroughly cowed and taught to long remember the
affair.</p>

<p>In former days such battles were, according to all accounts,
of fairly frequent occurrence, but nowadays, no doubt largely
due to the interference by European settlers, and the smaller
numbers of natives, one very rarely hears that any warfare is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
conducted on a large scale. Indeed, many of the one-time
bitterest enemies, such as the Larrekiya and Ponga Ponga,
Arunndta and Aluridja, Kukata and Wongapitcha, can now
be seen living in close proximity to each other, and apparently
on the best of terms.</p>

<p>Where inherited hatred sways, treachery brews. The
aggressors know that the most radical method to extinguish
the enemy is to take them unawares, and to slaughter them
before they can retaliate. For this purpose it is best to either
steal on them in the earliest hours of morning whilst they are
sleeping unsuspectingly, or to lie in ambush at a place, like a
waterhole, where the enemy is sure to call.</p>

<p>A council of war, consisting of the oldest and most
experienced men, is held to discuss the <i>modus operandi</i> at
length. Thereupon all eligible men are apprised of the
decisions arrived at. Considerable time is devoted to the
preparation of spears, sharpening of blades, and straightening
of shafts over a fire. Any weak spots, where the spears are
likely to break when put to the test in battle, are carefully
bound with kangaroo sinew, and the blades or stone-heads
re-embedded in porcupine grass resin. Quantities of red ochre
are ground and mixed with emu fat, with which the bodies of
all warriors are covered. Each man looks to his own spear-thrower,
and makes sure that it has not warped or split, and
that the handle and hook are secure; a warrior with a defective
spear-thrower would be next to useless on the battlefield. The
men tie their hair back tightly with human hair-string, and go
absolutely nude. The work is all done in a thorough and conscientious
way, yet there is every indication of humour about
the camp, and nowhere does one see any sign of fear or nervousness
on part of either the men who are going to fight, or of
their near relatives. There is even an indication of frivolity,
with much jabbering and laughter. The women assist
assiduously while the preparations are in progress, and add<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
considerably to the entertainment of their heroes, who are about
to depart. Even when at length the expedition makes a start,
some of the old gins run at the side of the men and keep on
joking with the men at the expense of the opponents, roars of
laughter every now and then announcing a particularly clever
sally from the lips of an old hag barely able to control herself
with excitement in her endeavour to incite the men.</p>

<p>Before leaving their camp in a body, all warriors congregate
in a circle on parade, holding their weapons balanced in the
spear-thrower. Two or three of the old men make a careful
scrutiny of the group and their outfit and give final instructions
as to how the campaign is to be conducted. Quite occasionally,
indeed, a general discussion might take place, at which any suggestions
of younger warriors are received and weighed by the
seniors, prior to departure. Then the official start is made.</p>

<p>As the little troop advances, the men begin to gesticulate and
brandish their weapons, whilst they dance, with their beards
poked between their lips and teeth. Occasionally they send
forth a loud, piercing yell resembling a war-whoop; then they
poise their weapons, at the same time stamping and vibrating
their legs, and deriding the enemy with a scurrilous tongue.</p>

<p>If the enemy is to be met in open battle, the place and time
of the proposed encounter are arranged beforehand by means
of carved wooden missives and special carriers.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the place, and <i>vis-à-vis</i> to the foe, vociferation
and antics continue to the verge of hysterical jactitation.
One or two of the most daring warriors, before hostilities have
actually begun in earnest, rush to the fore, and, placing themselves
in front of what might appear the strongest of the
opposite party, continue their antics in contempt of them. Thus
the patience of the enemy is harassed time after time; and in a
similar way the enemy reciprocates.</p>

<p>The moment will, however, arrive when one becomes a little
too daring or forward, and, with intention or otherwise, touches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
the person opposed to himself. The insulted warrior, who has
thus been called out, responds with a tremendous roar, and drives
straight at his opponent with his spear, using it as a lance.</p>

<p>In an instant the scene is changed. All participants retreat
to a respectable distance, about fifty feet or more, towards their
respective sides, amidst fearful yelling. The moment they reach
the new positions, the air becomes alive with spears, and the
fight has commenced in reality.</p>

<p>The throwing and aiming of the projectiles are good, but
the ducking and dodging of the selected victims are equally so.
During the whole term of the encounter, terrifying bawls are
heard, which are emitted by the enraged fighters, and responded
to by the excited women in the background. Thus the conflict
may last for an hour or two, without a casualty being recorded.
When a man is hit, the hideous yelling reaches its climax. The
wounded fellow, unless he be mortally hit or falls to the ground
unconscious, immediately backs out of the “firing line” under
cover of his shield, and seeks shelter behind the warriors, where
he is attended by the women, who still the flow of blood with
a packing of clay, gum leaves, powdered bird excrement, and
grease. Should a spear, or portion of such, still be lodged in
the wound, the assistance of an old man will in all probability
be called upon to extricate the piece. If, however, the spear-head
breaks in the attempted removal, no further operation is
undertaken then, and perhaps not until the natural suppurative
processes force the fragment near to the surface of the body.
The aborigines, although they use a knife freely in the mutilation
of their bodies, are not sufficiently skilful as surgeons that
they can make an incision into muscle or other tissue to extricate
a foreign body, such as a broken spear-head, even if the
point is pressing the skin outwards on the side opposite the
laceration, and the barbs prevent it being pulled back.</p>

<p>When a man collapses on the spot, as from a mortal wound,
a regular tussle ensues, in an endeavour to secure the body,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
between his friends and foes. The former run considerable risk
while they expose their figures to the bombardment of spears;
they are, however, covered by others, who come forth to
specially shepherd them; often, too, a confused hand-to-hand
skirmish follows, during which one or two more are wounded.
Should it so happen that a man now falls on the opposite side,
a compromise is effected, which permits either side to carry off
their wounded in peace. In fact, if the disabled men happen
to be of important position or particular valour, the casualty
may lead to a permanent armistice.</p>

<p>The aboriginal of Australia does not bear chronic malice
towards an ordinary or casual enemy, but soon finds a plausible
excuse to throw a damper on his fighting ardour; very frequently,
indeed, a bloodthirsty-looking crowd drown their enmity
in a combined and convivial festivity, during which the
late enemies jest, dance, and sing together. The past is soon
forgotten; his revenge appeased, a native immediately reverts
to his daily routine and peaceful life. With him revenge is not
necessarily individual; the wrong-doing of one tribesman might
have to be suffered for by another, maybe innocent, man of the
same blood. This blood-revenge, which of course is practised
by even the most civilized nations, is often the cause of the
death of an innocent white man, who happens to be travelling
through the tribal ground, where recently another white man
has maltreated or assaulted the natives.</p>

<p>In districts where the boomerang is used, a number of these
weapons is carried in the belts of the belligerents. When the
parties are within seeing distance of each other, each side begins
to throw its boomerangs, making them fly high in the air towards
the enemy and return to their respective owner. The
demonstration is repeated time after time, as the contending
parties draw near to each other, until at length the boomerangs
fly well over the opponents’ heads on either side. This is
forsooth an awe-inspiring spectacle and has the desired effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
of arousing the fighters’ ire to a very high pitch. At a later
stage, boomerangs are employed in actual battle.</p>

<p>In place of the boomerang, the club or the waddy is not
infrequently carried as an auxiliary weapon, but its use is
restricted to fighting at close quarters.</p>

<p>During the various encounters, as here briefly described,
shields are generally carried to parry the missiles directed
against the bodies of the combatants. In the case of the light
reed-spears, however, the wommera alone is used for such
purpose. The fighters’ greatest safety is nevertheless in their
wonderful skill at dodging the projectiles. In hand to hand
fighting, with club or boomerang, the shield is invariably used
to considerable advantage.</p>

<p>Whilst undertaking their reconnoitres, the scouts carry slippers,
which they wear when it is necessary to hide the individual
tracks of their party. These slippers are generally known as
“kurdaitja-shoes”; they consist of a thick pad or sole of emu
feathers, knitted together with string and clotted blood, and
an “upper” of neatly plaited human hair-string. The wearer of
such “kurdaitja-shoes” leaves shallow, oval tracks in the sand,
which, if seen by any other natives, occasion much alarm, being
immediately recognized as those of an enemy on a treacherous
mission; if the enemy is not discovered, the tracks are regarded
as those of the “<i>Kurdaitja</i>,” an evil spirit about to molest
the tribe.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of a battle, it depends entirely upon the
terms, under which arms were laid down, as to who appropriates
the bodies of any fallen warriors. If friendly relations are
established immediately after cessation of hostilities, a mutual
exchange is effected, by means of which the relatives might
come in possession of the bodies of any warriors who fell. If,
on the other hand, the hatred has not abated after the battle,
whatever bodies were captured during the affray belong to that
party who were fortunate enough to secure them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>The natives, who have been in the meantime joined by the
women, retreat towards their main camp, and carry the corpse
or corpses of their fallen upon their shoulders to a place decided
upon. There elaborate obsequies are instituted. It is, moreover,
the custom to cut portions of the soft parts from a dead
warrior’s body, whether he be friend or foe, and to eat them.
The belief is that by so doing the brave qualities of the departed
soldier will be kept among the tribe and will not all be taken
away by the spirit when it migrates to the ancestral hunting
grounds. The pieces which are most commonly consumed by the
mourners (or victors) are the kidney fat and the marrow of the
long bones; the Gulf of Carpentaria tribes eat pieces of the
muscle and occasionally of the liver. This is another reason why
the Australian aborigines are often referred to as cannibals;
but the title is unmerited. The native of Australia does not
go head-hunting and does not organize expeditions, whose object
is to slay people upon whom they can feast. We are not justified
in calling him a cannibal; the most we can say of him is
that opportunity might make him an occasional man-eater.</p>

<span class="smaller">SPEARS</span></h2>

<p>Spears used for four different purposes—Technically two divisions
recognized—Descriptions of types.</p>

</div>

<p>Spears made by aboriginal Australians serve for four distinct
purposes—for fighting, for hunting, for ceremonial, and for
recreation, but it would never do to make these the basis of
classification.</p>

<p>Technically, however, we recognize two main divisions, into
which Australian spears can be made to fall, the one including
all spears made out of a single piece of hard wood, the other
those constructed of two or more pieces. With very few exceptions,
the former are projected by the hand alone, the latter
by means of a specially designed spear-thrower.</p>

<p>The simplest type of spear, found everywhere in Australia,
consists merely of a long stick, more or less straightened artificially,
and roughly pointed at one or both ends. Along the
north coast of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and
Queensland alike, the spear is made of light mangrove wood;
in central Australia it is of acacia; and in the south it is, or
was, of mallee. Vide <a href="#figure05">Fig. 5</a>, <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>Some of the tribes spend considerable time at straightening
these spears. The method in vogue is to place the stick with
its curved portion in hot ashes, and, after a while, to bend it
over a stone until the right shape is obtained; a little emu fat
is often applied to the spot before it is heated.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="figure05" style="max-width: 29.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure05.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 5. Types of spears.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Others devote much attention to the shaping of the spear by
scraping and rasping its surface. Exceptionally straight and
smoothed mulga spears were made by the Barcoo natives of the
Durham Downs district and by the Dieri (<i>b</i>), whilst on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
north coast, the Crocker Islanders’ spears are deserving of the
same comments; the latter, in addition, are decorated by a few
delicate engravings in the form of circumferential rings and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
wavy longitudinal bands composed of short parallel transverse
lines. The Arunndta groove the spears lengthwise with a
stone adze.</p>

<p>An improvement on this type is rendered by the cutting of a
pointed blade at one end of the spear (<i>c</i>). Some of the best
specimens come from the eastern Arunndta in the Arltunga
district. The blade is symmetrically cut, sharply edged, and
smooth; the remaining portion of the spear is grooved longitudinally
throughout its length.</p>

<p>All the above-mentioned types of spear are thrown by hand.</p>

<p>A straight, single-piece, hard-wood spear is made more effective
by splicing a barb on to the point with kangaroo or emu
sinew (<i>d</i>). The barb being directed away from the point, the
spear cannot be withdrawn without forcibly tearing it through
the flesh of the animal or man it has entered. The natives living
along the Great Australian Bight, from Port Lincoln to King
George Sound in Western Australia, used to make this the principal
weapon; the spear was up to twelve feet in length, perfectly
straight and smooth, and was thrown with a spear-thrower.</p>

<p>A rare and perhaps unique variety was found at Todmorden
on the Alberga River in the possession of an Aluridja. It was
a simple, one-piece, bladed spear, like that described of the
Arltunga natives, but it had two wooden barbs tied against
one and the same side of the blade with kangaroo sinew, one
above the other, at distances of three and six inches, respectively,
from the point.</p>

<p>The hard-wood spears may have the anterior end carved, on
one or two sides, into a number of barbs of different shape and
size. The simplest and most rudimentary forms were to be
met with among the weapons of the practically extinct tribes
of the lower reaches of the River Murray, including Lake
Alexandria. The shaft was of mallee and by no means always
straight and smooth; its anterior end, for a distance of from
twelve to eighteen inches, had from five to six medium-sized,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
thorn-like barbs or spikes, which were directed backwards and
cut out of the wood, on one or two sides. More rarely one
would find spears with a three-sided serrature, consisting of
something like two dozen small barbs, directed backwards, extending
in three longitudinal lines over a distance of about
fifteen inches; at the top the serrated lines merged into a single
strong point. Vide <a href="#figure05">Fig. 5</a>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, and <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>“He stands aghast, with his eyes staring at the treacherous pointer, and with
his hands lifted as though to ward off the lethal medium....”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The most formidable weapons of this kind are those still in daily
use as hunting and fighting spears on Melville and Bathurst
Islands (<i>h</i>). The head of this type has many barbs carved
on one side, and occasionally on two diametrically opposite sides.
There are from ten to thirty barbs pointing backwards, behind
which from four to eight short serrations project straight outwards,
whilst beyond them again occasionally some six or more
small barbs point forwards. The spears have a long, sharp,
bladed point. The barbs are symmetrically carved, and each
has sharp lateral edges which end in a point. The size of the
barbs varies in different specimens. Many of the spears are
longitudinally grooved or fluted, either for the whole length
or at the head end only. Usually these weapons are becomingly
decorated with ochre, and may have a collar of human hair-string
wound tightly round the shaft at the base of the head.</p>

<p>Some of the heaviest of these spears are up to sixteen feet
long, and would be more fitly described as lances.</p>

<p>The most elaborate, and at the same time most perfect,
specimens of the single-piece wooden spears of aboriginal
manufacture are the ceremonial pieces of the Melville
Islanders. These have a carved head measuring occasionally
over four feet in length and four inches in width, consisting
of from twelve to twenty-five paired, symmetrical, leaf-shaped
or quadrilateral barbs, whose sides display a remarkable
parallelism. The barbs are surmounted by a long tapering
point emanating from the topmost pair; and very frequently
one finds an inverted pair of similar barbs beneath the series<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
just mentioned. Occasionally, too, the two pairs opposed to
each other at the bottom are fused into one, and a square hole
is cut into the bigger area of wood thus gained on either side
of the shaft (<i>i</i>).</p>

<p>The structure may be further complicated by cutting away
the point at the top, and separating the paired series of barbs
by a narrow vertical cleft down the middle (<i>j</i>).</p>

<p>We shall now turn our attention to spears whose head and
shaft are composed of separate parts. In the construction of
these, two principal objects are aimed at by the aboriginal, the
first being to make the missile travel more accurately through
space, and in accordance with the aim, the second to make the
point more cruel and deadly. Whereas, with one exception,
all the single-piece spears, so far discussed, are projected or
wielded with the hand only, in every instance of the multi-pieced
spears, a specially designed spear-thrower is used for
that purpose.</p>

<p>The native has learned by experience that weight in the forepart
of the spear will enable him to throw and aim with greater
precision. One has only to watch the children and youths
during a sham-fight to realize how well it is known that the
heavier end of a toy spear must be directed towards the target
whilst the lighter end is held in the hand. Green shoots of
many tussocks, or their seed-stalks, and the straight stems of
reeds or bullrushes, are mostly used. They are cut or pulled
at the root in order that a good butt-end may be obtained, and
carefully stripped of leaves; the toy weapons are then ready
for throwing. One is taken at a time and its thin end held
against the inner side of the point of the right index finger;
it is kept in that position with the middle finger and thumb.
Raising the spear in a horizontal position, the native extends
his arm backwards, and, carefully selecting his mark, shies his
weapon with full force at it.</p>

<p>The simplest type of a combination made to satisfy the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
of an artificially weighted spear is one in which the
shaft consists of light wood and the head of heavier wood (<i>k</i>).
Roughly speaking, the proportion of light to heavy wood is
about half of one to half of the other. The old Adelaide tribe
used to select the combination of the light pithy flower-stalk
of the grass-tree with a straight pointed stick of mallee. The
western coastal tribes of the Northern Territory construct
small, and those of the Northern Kimberleys large spears composed
of a shaft of reed and a head of mangrove; the former
being four or at most five feet long, the latter from ten to
twelve. The joint between the two pieces is effected by inserting
the heavier wood into the lighter and sealing the union
with triodia-grass resin or beeswax. The Adelaide tribe used
the gum of the grass-tree.</p>

<p>The River Murray tribes used to make the point of the
mallee more effective by attaching to it a blade-like mass of
resin, into both edges of which they stuck a longitudinal row
of quartz flakes.</p>

<p>The Northern Kimberleys natives accomplish the same object
by fixing on to the top end of the mangrove stick a globular
mass of warm, soft resin, in which they embed a stone spear-head
(<i>l</i>). In certain parts of the Northern Territory one occasionally
meets with a similar type of spear, but such in all
probability is imported from the west.</p>

<p>The popular spear of central Australian tribes consists of a
light shaft fashioned out of a shoot of the wild tecoma bush
(<i>T. Australis</i>), which carries a long-bladed head of hard mulga
wood. The junction is made between the two pieces by cutting
them both on a slope, sticking these surfaces together with hot
resin, and securely binding them with kangaroo tendon. The
bottom end is similarly bound and a small hole made in its
base to receive the point of the spear-thrower (<i>m</i>).</p>

<p>As often as not the blade has a single barb of wood bound
tightly against it with tendon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>It is often difficult to find a single piece of tecoma long
enough to make a suitable shaft, in which case two pieces are
taken and neatly joined somewhere within the lower, and
thinner, half with tendon. The shoots, when cut, are always
stripped of their bark and straightened in the fire, the surfaces
being subsequently trimmed by scraping.</p>

<p>A very common type of spear, especially on the Daly River,
and practically all along the coast of the Northern Territory,
is one with a long reed-shaft, to which is attached, by means of
a mass of wax or gum, a stone-head, consisting of either
quartzite or slate, or latterly also of glass. The bottom end is
strengthened, to receive the point of the thrower, by winding
around it some vegetable fibre (<i>n</i>).</p>

<p>The natives of Arnhem Land now and then replace the stone
by a short piece of hard wood of lanceolate shape.</p>

<p>If now we consider the only remaining type—a light reed-shaft,
to which is affixed a long head of hard wood, with a
number of barbs cut on one or more edges—we find a great
variety of designs. The difference lies principally in the number
and size of the barbs; in most cases they point backwards, but
it is by no means rare to find a certain number of them pointing
the opposite way or standing out at right angles to the length
of the head. These spears belong principally to the northern
tribes of the Northern Territory.</p>

<p>The commonest form is a spear having its head carved into
a number of barbs along one side only, and all pointing backwards
(<i>o</i>). The number ranges from three to over two dozen,
the individual barbs being either short and straight or long and
curved, with the exception of the lowest, which in many examples
sticks out at right angles just above the point of insertion.
The point is always long and tapering. These spears are common
to the Larrekiya, Wogait, Wulna, and all Daly River
tribes.</p>

<p>1. Dieri grave, Lake Eyre district.</p>

<p>2. Yantowannta grave, Innamincka district.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The same pattern of barbs may be found carved symmetrically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
on the side diametrically opposite, or, indeed, it may be cut in
three planes.</p>

<p>An elegant, but rare, type is found among the weapons of
the Ponga Ponga, Mulluk Mulluk, and Wogait tribes on the
Daly River. Its hard-wood head is long and uniformly tapering
from its point of insertion to its sharp tip. On one side there
are very many small barbs, diminishing in size from the shaft
upwards; as many as one hundred barbs have been counted;
they point either slightly backwards or at right angles to the
length (<i>p</i>).</p>

<p>A spear in use on the Alligator River, and in the districts
south and west therefrom, has the barbs along the edge of the
anterior moiety directed backwards, whereas those of the posterior
portion point forwards. And occasionally one finds the
barbs arranged asymmetrically on two sides of the spear-head.</p>

<p>Finally, a rather remarkable type will be referred to, which
belongs to the Arnhem Land tribes, or rather to the country
extending from Port Essington to the Roper River, including
Groote Island and smaller groups lying off the coast. It is a
neat and comparatively small spear, about eight feet long on
an average. The head, instead of possessing a number of barbs,
has a series of eye-shaped holes cut along one of its sides, which
give the impression of being so many unfinished barbs, or so
many barbs with their points joined together (<i>q</i>). The major
axes of the holes are parallel and directed backwards; there may
be up to thirty holes present. Occasionally there are a few real
barbs cut near the shaft end of the head; or a number of incomplete
barbs may there be cut with their axes turned towards
the front of the spear. The point is always sharp and stands
back somewhat from the level of the uncut barbs.</p>

<p>For special purposes, like fishing, two or three of the simple-barbed
prongs are frequently affixed to a reed shaft with beeswax
or resin, and vegetable fibre. This combination is met
with all along the coast of the Northern Territory. The natives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
know very well that the chances of stabbing a fish with a trident
of this description are much greater than with a single prong.
As a matter of fact, a barbed spear with less than two prongs
is not normally used for fishing purposes, yet a plain, single-pronged
spear is often utilized when there is none of the other
kind available.</p>

<p>The Australian aboriginals do not poison their spears in the
ordinary sense of the word, but the Ponga Ponga and Wogait
tribes residing on the Daly River employ the vertebræ of large
fish, like the barramundi, which have previously been inserted
into decaying flesh, usually the putrid carcase of a kangaroo,
with the object of making the weapon more deadly. The bones
are tied to the head of a fighting spear. This is not a general
practice, however, and the spear never leaves the hands of the
owner. The natives maintain that by so doing they can kill
their enemy “quick fella.”</p>

<span class="smaller">SPEAR-THROWERS</span></h2>

<p>Principle of construction—How held—Some of the common types described—Other
uses.</p>

</div>

<p>To assist in the projection of a spear, the aboriginal has invented
a simple apparatus, which is commonly referred to as a
spear-thrower or wommera. In principle it is just a straight
piece of wood with a haft at one end and a small hook at the
other. In practice the hand seizes the haft, the hook is inserted
into the small pit at the bottom of the spear, and the shaft is
laid along the thrower and held there with two of the fingers
of the hand, which is clasping the haft. In this position, the
arm is placed well back, the point of the spear steadied or made
to vibrate, and, when the native has taken careful aim, the arm
is forcibly shot forwards. The missile flies through space, towards
its target, but the thrower is retained by the hand.</p>

<p>One of the simplest types was made by the tribes living
along the shores of the Great Australian Bight. It consists of
a flat piece of wood, about three feet long, roughly fluted
lengthwise and slightly sloped off at either extremity. At one
end a mass of resin forms a handle, in which, moreover, a
quartzite or flint scraper is embedded. At the other end a
wooden peg is affixed with resin against the flat surface of the
stick. Both surfaces of the implement are flat or slightly
convex; at Esperance Bay they are rather nicely polished, the
wood selected being a dark-coloured acacia. Towards the east,
however, as for instance at Streaky Bay, the inner side, i.e. the
one bearing the hook or peg, becomes concave and the outer
side convex. On Eyre Peninsula, the old Parnkalla tribe made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
the spear-thrower shorter but wider, and its section was distinctly
concave.</p>

<p>Northwards, through the territories of the Kukata, Arrabonna,
Wongapitcha, Aluridja, Arunndta, and Cooper Creek
tribes, the shape becomes leaf-shaped and generally of concave
section, with a well-shaped haft and broad flint scraper; the
peg is attached with resin and sinew. Within this same area,
another type is less frequently met with, which is of similar
shape, but flat; it is really used more for show purposes, and
for that reason is usually decorated with engraved circles and
lines, which during some of the ceremonies are further embellished
with ochre and coloured down.</p>

<p>The last-named is the prevalent type, which extends westwards
as an elongate form through the Murchison district right
through to the Warburton River, where it is again broader.
In both the areas mentioned, the inner surface of the spear-thrower
is deeply incised with series of parallel, angular bands
made up of transverse notches. In the south of Western Australia,
the shape remains the same, but the incised ornamentation
disappears.</p>

<p>Yet another variety comes from the old Narrinyerri tribe and
from the lower reaches of the River Murray, where it was
known as “<i>taralje</i>.” It is a small, flat, spatulate form, elongated
at both ends, the lower (and longer) prolongation making the
handle, the upper carrying a point of bone or tooth deeply
embedded in resin. The inner side, against which the spear is
laid, is flat, the outer surface being convex. The handle is
circular in section and is rounded off at the bottom to a blunt
point. The convex side is occasionally decorated with a number
of pinholes, arranged in a rudely symmetrical pattern.</p>

<p>All through the northern districts of the Northern Territory
and the Northern Kimberleys, the principal type is a long
light-wood blade, tapering slightly from the handle end to the
point and having comparatively flat or slightly convex sides.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
A handle is shaped by rounding off the ends and cutting away
some of the wood symmetrically on each side, a few inches
down. A clumsy-looking peg is attached to one of the flat
surfaces at the opposite, narrower end with beeswax. The peg
is made big on account of the instrument being exclusively used
to propel the reed-spears, which are naturally hollow, and
consequently have a large opening or pit at the bottom end.
This type of thrower is nearly always decorated in an elaborate
way with ochre. When used, the thrower and spear are held
by the right hand in such a way that the shaft of the latter
passes, and is held, between the thumb and index finger, the
remaining fingers holding the handle of the thrower. Vide
<a href="#plate14">Plate XIV</a>, 2.</p>

<p>A spear-thrower used exclusively for projecting the small
variety of reed-spear is known to the Larrekiya, Wogait,
Wordaman, Berringin, and a few other coastal tribes of the
Northern Territory. It consists of a rod of hard wood, four
feet or so in length, tapering a little towards either end. A
lump of resin is attached to one end, and, whilst warm and
plastic, is moulded into a blunt point, which fits into the hole
at the bottom of the spear. At about five inches from the
opposite end, a rim of resin is fixed, and from it a layer, decreasing
in thickness, is plastered around the stick to near the
extremity. When using this thrower, the hand is placed above
the resin-rim, and the shaft of the spear is held by the thumb
against the top of the middle finger, without the aid of the
index finger. In addition to this, its principal function, the
thrower is often used for making fire, the native twirling its
lower point against another piece of wood.</p>

<p>A variety of the above type is found in the Gulf of Carpentaria
country, on the MacArthur River, which has a tassel
of human hair-string tied with vegetable fibre immediately
below the rim of resin around the handle.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable of all spear-throwers is made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
by the Larrekiya, and other Northern Territory tribes, consisting
of a long, leaf-shaped, and very thin, flexible blade, flat
on one side and slightly convex on the other. The peg is pear-shaped,
and is fixed with vegetable string and beeswax. The
handle is thick and cone-shaped, and covered with a thin layer
of resin or wax. It is ornamented with rows of small pits,
which are pricked into the mass while warm with the point of
a fish bone or sharpened stick. The instrument is so thin and
fragile that only experienced men dare handle it. At times the
blade is curved like a sabre.</p>

<p>In addition to serving as a projecting apparatus, most of the
hard-wood spear-throwers with sharp edges are used for producing
fire by the rubbing or sawing process; those of concave
section also take the place of a small cooleman, in which ochre,
down, blood, and other materials are stored during the “making
up” period of a ceremony.</p>

<p>Any of the flat types of spear-thrower may be used for making
fire by the “sawing process.” The edge of the implement is
rubbed briskly across a split piece of soft wood until the red-hot
powder produced by the friction kindles some dry grass
which was previously packed into the cleft. The spark is then
fanned into a flame, as previously referred to (<a href="#Page_111">page 111</a>).</p>

<span class="smaller">BURIAL AND MOURNING CUSTOMS</span></h2>

<p>Customs depend upon a variety of circumstances—Child burial—Cremation
disavowed—Interment—Graves differently marked—Carved
tomb-posts of Melville Islanders—Sepulchral sign-posts of Larrekiya—Platform
burial—Mummification of corpse—Skeleton eventually
buried—Identification of supposed murderer—Pathetic scenes
in camp—Self-inflicted mutilations—Weird elegies—Name of deceased
never mentioned—Hut of deceased destroyed—Widowhood’s
tribulation—Pipe-clay masks and skull-caps—Mutilations—Second
Husbands—Collecting and concealing the dead man’s bones—Treatment
of skull—Final mourning ceremony.</p>

</div>

<p>The burial and mourning ceremonies, if any, attendant upon
the death of a person, depend largely upon the tribe, the age,
and the social standing or status of the individual concerned.
Old people who have become “silly” (i.e. childish), and who
in consequence do not take an active part in any of the tribal
functions or ceremonies, are never honoured with a big funeral,
but are quietly buried in the ground. The reason for this is
that the natives believe that the greater share of any personal
charms and talents possessed by the senile frame have already
migrated to the eternal home of the spirit. As a matter of
fact, the old person’s spirit has itself partly quitted the body
and whiles for the most time in the great beyond. For precisely
the same reason, it often happens that a tribe, when undergoing
hardship and privation brought about by drought, necessitating
perhaps long marches under the most trying conditions, knocks
an old and decrepit person on the head, just as an act of
charity in order to spare the lingering soul the tortures, which
can be more readily borne by the younger members. These
ideas exist all over Australia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>When infants die, they are kept or carried around by the
mothers, individual or tribal, for a while in a food-carrier, and
then buried without any demonstration. The extinct Adelaide
tribes required of the women to carry their dead children about
with them on their backs until the bodies were shrivelled up
and mummified. The women alone attended to the burial of
the child when eventually it was assigned to a tree or the
ground.</p>

<p>But at the demise of a person in the prime of his or her life,
and of one who has been a recognized power in life, the case
is vastly different. Both before and after the “burial” of the
corpus, a lengthy ceremony is performed, during which all sorts
of painful mutilations are inflicted amongst the bereaved relatives,
amidst the accompaniment of weird chants and horribly
uncanny wails. Before proceeding with the discussion of the
attendant ceremonies, however, we shall give an outline of the
different methods adopted in Australia for the disposal of the
dead.</p>

<p>Cremation is nowhere practised for the simple reason that
the destruction of the bony skeleton would debar the spirit
from re-entering a terrestrial existence.</p>

<p>The spirit is regarded as the indestructible, or really immortal,
quantity of a man’s existence; and it is intimately
associated with the skeleton. The natives tender, as an analogy,
the big larva of the Cossus or “witchedy,” which lies buried in
the bark of a gum tree. As a result of its ordinary metamorphosis,
the moth appears and flies away, leaving the empty shell
or, as the natives call it, the “skeleton” of the “dead” grub
behind. It is a common belief on the north coast that the
spirit of a dead person returns from the sky by means of a
shooting star, and when it reaches the earth, it immediately
looks around for its old skeleton. For this reason the relatives
of a dead man carefully preserve the skeletal remains, carry
them around for a while, and finally store them in a cave.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>Stillborn children are usually burnt in a blazing fire since
they are regarded as being possessed of the evil spirit, which
was the cause of the death.</p>

<p>The simplest method universally adopted, either alone or in
conjunction with other procedures, is interment.</p>

<p>Most of the central tribes, like the Dieri, Aluridja, Yantowannta,
Ngameni, Wongapitcha, Kukata, and others, bury
their dead, whilst the northern and southern tribes place the
corpse upon a platform, which they construct upon the boughs
of a tree or upon a special set of upright poles. The Ilyauarra
formerly used to practise tree-burial, but nowadays interment
is generally in vogue.</p>

<p>A large, oblong hole, from two to five feet deep, is dug in
the ground to receive the body, which has previously been
wrapped in sheets of bark, skins, or nowadays blankets. Two
or three men jump into the hole and take the corpse out of
the hands of other men, who are kneeling at the edge of the
grave, and carefully lower it in a horizontal position to the
bottom of the excavation. The body is made to lie upon the
back, and the head is turned to face the camp last occupied by
the deceased, or in the direction of the supposed invisible abode
of the spirit, which occupied the mortal frame about to be
consigned to the earth. The Arunndta quite occasionally place
the body in a natural sitting position. The Larrekiya, when
burying an aged person, place the body in a recumbent position,
usually lying on its right side, with the legs tucked up against
the trunk and the head reposing upon the hands, the position
reminding one of that of a <i>fœtus in utero</i>.</p>

<p>The body is covered with layers of grass, small sticks, and
sheets of bark, when the earth is scraped back into the hole.
But very often a small passage is left open at the side of the
grave, by means of which the spirit may leave or return to the
human shell (i.e. the skeleton) whenever it wishes.</p>

<p>The place of sepulture is marked in a variety of ways. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
many cases only a low mound is erected over the spot, which in
course of time is washed away and finally leaves a shallow
depression.</p>

<p>The early south-eastern (Victorian) and certain central tribes
place the personal belongings, such as spear and spear-thrower
in the case of a man, and yam-stick and cooleman in the case
of a woman, upon the mound, much after the fashion of a
modern tombstone. The now fast-vanishing people of the
Flinders Ranges clear a space around the mound, and construct
a shelter of stones and brushwood at the head end. They cover
the corpse with a layer of foliage and branches, over which they
place a number of slabs of slate. Finally a mound is erected
over the site.</p>

<p>The Adelaide and Encounter Bay tribes built wurleys or
brushwood shelters over the mound to serve the spirit of the
dead native as a resting place.</p>

<p>In the Mulluk Mulluk, when a man dies outside his own
country, he is buried immediately. A circular space of ground
is cleared, in the centre of which the grave is dug. After interment,
the earth is thrown back into the hole and a mound raised,
which is covered with sheets of paper-bark. The bark is kept in
place by three or four flexible wands, stuck into the ground at
their ends, but closely against the mound, transversely to its
length. A number of flat stones are laid along the border of
the grave and one or two upon the mound.</p>

<p>In the Northern Kimberleys of Western Australia, when an
unauthorized trespasser is killed by the local tribes, the body is
placed into a cavity scooped out of an anthill, and covered up.
In a few hours, the termites rebuild the defective portion of the
hill, and the presence of a corpse is not suspected by an avenging
party, even though it be close on the heels of the murderers.</p>

<p>The Dieri, in the Lake Eyre district of central Australia,
dispense with the mound, but in its place they lay a number of
heavy saplings longitudinally across the grave. Their eastern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
neighbours, the Yantowannta, expand this method by piling up
an exceptionally large mound, which they cover with a stout
meshwork of stakes, branches, and brushwood lying closely
against the earth (<a href="#plate25">Plate XXV</a>, 1 and 2).</p>

<p>One of the most elaborate methods is that in vogue on Melville
and Bathurst Islands. The ground immediately encompassing
the grave is cleared, for a radius of half a chain or more,
and quantities of clean soil thrown upon it to elevate the space
as a whole. The surface is then sprinkled with ashes and shell
debris. The mound stands in the centre of this space, and is
surrounded by a number of artistically decorated posts of hard
and heavy wood, or occasionally of a lighter fibrous variety
resembling that of a palm. Each of the posts bears a distinctive
design drawn in ochre upon it; several of the series in addition
have the top end carved into simple or complicated knobs; occasionally
a square hole is cut right through the post, about a foot
from the top, leaving only a small, vertical strip of wood at
each side to support the knob (<a href="#figure14">Fig. 14</a>). The designs are
drawn in red, yellow, white, and black, and represent human,
animal, emblematical, and nondescript forms.</p>

<p>The Larrekiya erect a sort of sign-post, at some distance
from the grave, consisting of an upright pole, to the top of
which a bundle of grass is fixed. A cross-piece is tied beneath
the grass, which projects unequally at the sides and carries an
additional bundle at each extremity. The structure resembles
a scarecrow with outstretched arms, the longer of which has a
small rod inserted into the bundle of grass to indicate the direction
of the grave. Suspended from the other arm, a few
feathers or light pieces of bark are allowed to sway in the wind
and thus serve to attract the attention of any passers-by.</p>

<p>When the body is to be placed upon a platform, it is carried,
at the conclusion of the preliminary mourning ceremonies,
shoulder high by the bereaved relatives to the place previously
prepared for the reception of the corpse. A couple of the men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
climb upon the platform and take charge of the body, which
is handed to them by those remaining below. They carefully
place it in position, and lay a few branches over it, after which
they again descend to join the mourners. The platform is constructed
of boughs and bark, which are spread between the
forks of a tree or upon specially erected pillars of wood.</p>

<p>The Adelaide tribe used to tie the bodies of the dead into a
sitting position, with the legs and arms drawn up closely against
the chest, and in that position kept them in the scorching sun
until the tissues were thoroughly dried around the skeleton;
then the mummy was placed in the branches of a tree, usually
a casuarina or a ti-tree. Along the reaches of the River Murray
near its mouth, the mummification of the corpse was accelerated
by placing it upon a platform and smoking it from a big fire,
which was kept burning underneath; all orifices in the body
were previously closed up. When the epidermis peeled off, the
whole surface of the corpse was thickly bedaubed with a mixture
of red ochre and grease, which had the consistency of an ordinary
oil-paint. A similar mummification process is adopted by certain
of the coastal tribes of north-eastern Queensland.</p>

<p>The Larrekiya, Wogait, and other northern tribes smear red
ochre all over the surface of the corpse, prior to placing it aloft,
in much the same manner as they do when going to battle.
The mourners, moreover, rub some of the deceased’s fat over
their bodies. When eventually all the soft parts have been
removed from the skeleton by birds of prey, and by natural
processes of decomposition, the relatives take the radius from
the left arm, which they carry away with them. The remaining
bones are collected and wrapped up in paperbark, and the parcel
buried.</p>

<p>“The novice lies on his back and rests his head against the operator’s
thighs, while a number of men sit around in a semi-circle.” The operator is
seen in the act of applying the rod with his right hand, while he is
striking it with a pebble held in the opposite hand.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the Northern Kimberleys of Western Australia, the relatives
wait until the body has so far decomposed that it begins
to drip, at which stage they place a number of pebbles or other
articles either in a row or in a circle underneath the platform.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
Each pebble represents a person who is considered as a likely
cause of the death they are bemoaning. Periodical inspections are
made of the place, and notice is taken of the drops which have
fallen from the corpse. Should it so happen that the wind has
blown them in the direction of any one particular stone, which
has thereby been moistened, the person represented by that pebble
is looked upon as the one responsible for the fellow’s death; a
resolution is forthwith carried to “bone” him to death. At
the same time the visitors keep a vigilant lookout for any tracks
near the grave, which might inform them of the presence of a
spirit nearby. Like the Northern Territory tribes they, too,
later collect the bones of the deceased and wrap them up in
paperbark. These parcels, together with the skull, are deposited
in the crevices of rocks outcropping within their haunts, or they
are stuck away in a cave, if such be available.</p>

<p>Great is the hullabaloo in a camp when a person of importance
breathes his last. Moans and deep sobbing notes are
followed by loud yells and spasms of barbarous shrieks, which
it is difficult to believe are human; and the yelping hordes of
dogs, which are found in every camp, in no small way intensify
the din. After a while the pandemonium settles down to a
more orderly wailing, although every now and then there might
be a spontaneous outburst of the heart-rending yelling again,
which can only be likened to a long-drawn canine or, more
nearly, a dingo-like howl. The note is taken up by all members
of the little community; and the moment the noise is heard by
anybody strolling or hunting in the environment he, without
deliberation, hastens back to camp to join in the wailing. The
men sit with their knees drawn up and their arms thrown
around them, covering their faces whilst they are sobbing. The
women throw themselves upon the ground, or over the body
of the departed, in utter despair; they are later joined by the
men. Every now and then the lubras rise, and, seizing a sharp
stick with both their hands, they cut deep gashes into the crown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
of their heads. Then, as the blood pours down over their
faces and bodies, the wailing is accentuated with additional
vehemence. At times some terrible wounds are inflicted during
this part of the obsequies. The widow often cuts a long,
median gash right along the scalp. The men, on the other
hand, flourish their big stone knives, with which they hack their
bodies in a revolting manner. In the Katherine River district,
the nearest relatives on the male side not infrequently cut their
thighs in such a way that almost the entire mass of muscles on
the extensor side is severed, and the man makes himself <i>hors de
combat</i>. A general mêlée now ensues, during which women
deface themselves and each other without restraint, the places
of predilection being the head and back. Each mourner submits
to the mutilation voluntarily and without flinching. The
women, too, make free use of their nulla-nullas, with which
they crack each other over the head. But a short while after
they will seat themselves in groups about the body, with their
arms tenderly thrown around each other, crying bitterly.</p>

<p>Repeatedly I have been present when sad or distressing news
has unexpectedly come to hand, or when one of the tribe meets
with a painful accident which may be considered fatal, and
have noticed with what amount of undisguised sympathy such
are received on the part of the women-folk. On one occasion I
remember a young gin falling from a high cliff on the Finke
River and sustaining a concussion of the brain. As she lay
unconscious on the ground, all other women present at the
time tore out great quantities of hair from their scalps, and
then threw themselves into some spiny tussocks of porcupine
grass which grew close-by. The poisonous sting of the porcupine
grass is very painful, even when only one enters the skin;
but the agony produced by a large number piercing the naked
body must be excruciating.</p>

<p>The Larrekiya men lacerate their upper arms and thighs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
with stone knives, and cut their foreheads with the embedded
flints of any handy implements. Both men and women cover
their naked bodies with ashes and pipeclay, and, after the preliminary
uproar has calmed down somewhat, the females start
a doleful chant which sounds something like: “<i>Nge-e-u, hö-hö-un-un</i>.”
To this the men respond with long-drawn monotones
resembling: “<i>He-e-ö, he-e-ö, he-e-ö</i>,” the “<i>n</i>” and “<i>un</i>” above,
and the “<i>ö</i>” below, sounding like sobs.</p>

<p>The chanting is kept up all the time the corpse is “lying in
state,” if one be permitted to make use of this phrase in connection
with a primitive burial ceremony. Even whilst the body
is being conveyed upon the shoulders of the aboriginal pall-bearers,
the wailing continues in a systematic manner.</p>

<p>I remember once attending a native funeral at Brocks’ Creek
in the Northern Territory, when a gin had died who came
from a far-distant tribe beyond the Victoria River. Being a
stranger, the local tribal honours could not be bestowed upon
her remains, but the local natives, who volunteered to bury her,
could not let the opportunity pass without singing in a
mournful strain as they carried her to rest. The gin’s dialect
was unknown, and the local tribe had been in the habit of
conversing with her in ordinary “pidgin English.” Consequently
they concocted a little refrain of their own to suit the
occasion. It ran “Poor beggar Jinny, him bin die,” and was
rendered in a sing-song style, like a decimal repeater, throughout
the ceremony.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Australia it is the custom among the
indigenous people never to mention the name of the person
whose death is being lamented. This rule is so far-reaching
that should there be more than one tribesman holding the same
name, the one surviving his namesake immediately changes his
appellation. If, too, the name of the dead one happened to be
that of an animal or place, a new word is immediately introduced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
in the vocabulary of the tribe in place of the former.
Thus allusion to the dead man’s name is entirely avoided. The
reason for this strange custom is that the tribespeople want the
spirit of the departed not to be molested; by calling aloud the
name of one who has gone beyond, the spirit might be persuaded
to come back and haunt the camp; the natives are in constant
dread of this. On the other hand, by not addressing the spirit,
there is no reason for it to leave the happy ancestral grounds,
in which it can consort with all its kin long-departed.</p>

<p>For much the same reason, the hut or wurley of the dead
person is immediately destroyed by the relatives of the dead
man; if the habitation is allowed to stand, the spirit of the dead
will endeavour to come back and occupy it. The natives would
be continually encountering the ghost, if not actually then certainly
in their imagination, and the fear of such a possibility
would make their existence intolerable. Most of the tribes,
moreover, so soon as they have destroyed the dead man’s wurley,
instantly leave the district and select another camping site, well
removed from the latter. The only exception to this general
rule is the Adelaide tribe who, as previously mentioned, used
to build a special bark hut over the grave for the spirit to
dwell in.</p>

<p>The person who fares worst is a widow. To begin with,
she is required to absent herself and live apart from the rest
of the people in a small humpy of her own; and she is not
allowed to eat anything during the term of the mourning
ceremonies. Quite apart from the general avoidance of
mentioning the deceased’s name, a widow is positively forbidden
to speak to anyone for a term of from a week or two to several
months. During all that time, she must observe the strictest
rules of tribal mourning; for, if she does not, the spirit will
see that her late husband’s memory is not sufficiently revered,
and it will starve the woman to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>Directly after the death of her husband, a Yantowannta
woman must cut off her hair, short to the scalp, and burn it.
In its place, she applies a thick coating of pipeclay paste, which
is periodically added to if there be a tendency for it to crumble
away. In addition, she covers most of her face with a similar
paste which adheres to the skin like a mask. Vide <a href="#plate26">Plate
XXVI</a>, 2.</p>

<p>The early Murray River tribes made a skull-cap of burned
gypsum or lime, about three inches thick, which the widows
had to wear during the term of mourning. These encumbrances
weighed up to sixteen pounds. The hair was generally
removed previously by singeing it with hot ashes.</p>

<p>In addition the relict has to regularly cover her body and
face with white ashes. In the Daly Waters district, whenever
she pays a visit to her late husband’s burial place, she will
submit herself to the agony of re-opening the wound in her
scalp, until it bleeds profusely, to prove how deep her sorrow is.</p>

<p>The Aluridja widows do not cut their hair short, but smear
pipe-clay paste and ashes thickly over the scalp, intimately
mixing it with the woolly growth. Often the hair is worked
up into a large number of locks or strands, round which the
white paste is moulded in such a way that the head is surrounded
by an array of pendant, cylindrical masses resembling
so many candles (<a href="#plate26">Plate XXVI</a>, 1).</p>

<p>A woman, upon the decease of her husband, becomes the
property of her late partner’s brother; if there are more than
one brother surviving, she falls to the senior among them. In
the case of no brothers remaining or existing, she is claimed by
the dead husband’s nearest (male) tribal relative. The law
prevails practically all over the Southern Continent. It is not
until she is actually received by her new husband that the
woman is permitted to speak to anyone. This usually ends
the first period of mourning, so far as the gin is concerned, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
she returns to live with the others in the main camp; but in
most cases she will continue to smear pipe-clay over her scalp
for some time longer.</p>

<p>An Arunndta woman who survives three tribal husbands is
not required by law to marry again, and she is, consequently,
left unmolested.</p>

<p>The second period of public mourning is a comparatively
short one; it is begun by collecting the dead man’s bones from
the tree or platform. In nearly every case the bulk of the bones
are packed in sheets of paperbark and hidden or buried. In
the north-central and north-western districts, the parcels are
either hidden in a cave, buried in an anthill, or stuck into the
fork of a dead tree. The cranium is often smashed to pieces
or the facial skeleton broken away from the skull-roof. In the
old Narrinyerri and certain tribes of the Adelaide plains the
calvarium was used as a drinking vessel; a handle was attached
by fastening a piece of strong fur-string to the <i>occiput</i> through
the <i>foramen magnum</i>, on the one side, and to the frontal portion,
after breaking a passage through the orbital cavities, on
the other. Many tribes besmear the skulls with red ochre
before assigning them to their last resting place. In the
Northern Kimberleys some of the sepulchral caves are so
crowded with skulls, arranged in perfect order, that one is reminded
of the classical catacombs.</p>

<p>The women are not present when the bones are collected,
but, remaining in camp, they start to wail afresh, and even
resort to further mutilating the body. When the men return,
carrying with them the radius of the dead man, a ceremony
is conducted, in which both sexes participate. The women,
including the widow, now discard the white cover of pipe-clay
and ashes; and in its place they decorate their bodies with red
and yellow ochre, and occasionally with charcoal. These colours
are applied in vertical bands or lines over the chest and back;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
whilst across the shoulders there are usually a few horizontal
lines. The men have more elaborate designs worked over their
chests and backs with ochre and kaolin. After the ceremony
is over, the radius is either buried or claimed by the deceased’s
brother, who uses it as a pointing-bone, it playing a particularly
important role during any expedition, which may be undertaken
against the tribe suspected of foul play in connection with his
relative’s death.</p>

<p>It is difficult for an European living in the twentieth century
to train his mind into the way of thinking like an aboriginal.
To require of a person to do so would be like asking his
reasoning to slip back through the long ages of progress and
mental development, which are primarily responsible for his
now being able to hold a foremost position amongst his fellow
creatures. The convenience of modern achievements so transcends
the awkwardness of primal ways that we might as well
suggest to him that the better way of meeting an absent friend
would be to walk to a spot he was last seen at, than to catch an
electric train bound for the city and despatch a message from
the nearest telegraph office to ensure the meeting. The first
method would be the primitive, the second the up-to-date. On
the other hand, our present systems are satisfied to ascertain
a man’s individual identity—his Christian and surnames—but
to bother little about anything else. Some of our best families
certainly pride themselves upon their ancestral history, and
honour the crest which once ranked prominently in the social
world, but the general tendency, especially of a democratic
world, is to meet this sentiment with a satirical sneer. In consequence,
our national history is sacrificing much of its
constituent, individual charm, and our nomenclature, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
any original class-systems are concerned, is daily becoming more
meagre and commonplace. Nowadays a Smith is simply a
Smith, good or bad, with or without genealogical traditions and
records. And this is the point we are leading up to, which is
so very different with the aboriginal. His vocabulary bristles
with a nomenclature so full of ancestral derivations and traditional
origins that a single word combines at once identity with
genealogy; the English language does not contain a single word
which could convey the same amount of meaning; a number
are required to explain the sense. There is no such person as
a simple Smith among the aborigines; Smiths there might be,
but each is separately described and qualified by his appellation;
each person carries his crest, if not his pedigree, embodied
in his name. Everybody can understand the significance of the
name the moment he hears it; and this understanding is very
far-reaching, and as potent as the bonds of freemasonry.</p>

<p>Every individual has a number of names, some of which are
never publicly used, but are only known to members of the
tribe who stand in very close relationship to him. The names
are really more expressions of degree, rank, maturity, and
division, rather than personal appellations or addresses. All
elders who have officiated during the term of initiation of a
novice, or who have instructed or tended a child prior to its
attaining its independence, automatically assume a name or title,
which, within a restricted circle, explains the social standing of
the particular individual.</p>

<p>Then there are factious names, of a religious or sacred
character, each of which directly relates to the accepted affinity
existing between a living person and an ancestral spirit of semi-human
origin. These names are kept very secret, but are
embodied in the carved “<i>tjuringas</i>,” which are only exposed to a
limited number of persons upon rare occasions, and then very
temporarily.</p>

<p>The names which are most commonly applied to individuals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
are, in reality, pet or nicknames. A special characteristic, a
likeness, a scar, or an abnormity is immediately seized upon as
a mark of distinction to embody in the individual’s name.
Countless examples could be mentioned to illustrate this point.
For instance, a man of the Minning tribe at Eucla is called
“<i>Jinnabukarre</i>” (Lumpy-foot), an old Arunndta man is known
as “<i>Ulgna-bong</i>” (Blind-eye), and a Wongapitcha man as
“<i>Jinna-Kularrikna</i>” (Stink-foot). The name I generally
travel under amongst the Arunndta is “<i>Atutannya</i>” (Big
Man), having been thus christened by them on account of my
bodily height. Again, circumstances at birth or any presumed
causes of conception often determine the name of the offspring.
“<i>Unndulia</i>,” meaning a “shadow,” is both the name of a place
with a legend, situated in the MacDonnell Ranges, and of a
girl, who is supposed to have entered her mother’s womb there.
Many people have names of animals and birds, with which
they have some sort of mystic relationship and legendary
connections; in the Arunndta such names as “<i>Illiya</i>” (Emu),
“<i>Utnguringita</i>” (Witchedy Grub), “<i>Irridja</i>” (Eaglehawk),
“<i>Ladjia</i>” (Yam), and the like are daily met with.</p>

<p>Names are frequently compounded, the resulting word
embodying locality, peculiarity, ancestry, animal-relationship,
and division all in one. As a person grows older his name
usually becomes longer, and in a limited sense recounts his
biography. There is apparently no limitation to the length
of a name, but the whole word is rarely spoken; yet each
possessor of a long name commits it well to memory. The
longest personal appellation, which has come before our notice,
is that of a very aged woman of the Dieri tribe; expressed
phonetically it ran: “<i>Yangingurrekupulapaiawattimakantana</i>.”</p>

<p>The intricate and elaborate systems of nomenclature are
closely connected with their marriage laws and secret rites.
With a few exceptions, these are much the same all over Australia.
So far as their marriage systems are concerned, each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
tribe may be primarily split into two great divisions, between
which unions take place; but among members of one and the
same division such are forbidden under penalty of death.</p>

<p>Each moiety is further separated into sub-divisions or groups,
which are distinguished by a symbol related to a family-crest.
The symbol is representative of a natural object, such
as animal, bird, or plant, between which and the individual
a mysterious relationship is believed to endure. This peculiar
belief was first reported to exist among the Australian aborigines
by Sir George Grey in 1841, who ascertained that the general
name of the mysterious symbol with which an individual
identifies himself, was “<i>kobong</i>.” Of later years the word has
been replaced in works on Australian anthropology by “totem.”
No doubt “<i>Kobongism</i>” and “Totemism” are closely allied
conceptions of crude religious significance; but at the same time
the “totem” belongs originally to the American Indian, and it
is still an open question whether the imported word completely
and adequately embraces all fundamental conceptions of the
“<i>kobong</i>.”</p>

<p>Among the central tribes the mystical relationship between
the present individual and the object (animal or plant) is believed
to come through sacred semi-human ancestors which were
common to both; the relationship has been handed down from
one generation to another. See further, <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVII">Chapter XXVII</a>.</p>

<p>Each divisional group has a number of such “<i>kobongs</i>” or
“totems,” which practically control their marriage-systems.
Descent in a family is always reckoned from the mother’s side,
at any rate so far as the majority of tribes is concerned. To
take a simple example: A tribe is composed, say, entirely of
families named Jones and Smith. A Smith is only allowed
to marry a Jones, and a Jones a Smith. But, in addition, each
individual member of the two groups of families named has a
separate crest or symbol, such as, for instance, the cat, the dog,
the fowl, the rose. A further restriction is that no two members<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
of the same crest are allowed to join in matrimony, so that no
Cat-Jones can marry a Cat-Smith, nor a Dog-Smith a Dog-Jones,
because they are “related.” But a Cat-Jones may marry
a Dog-, a Fowl-, or a Rose-Smith, and <i>vice versa</i>, without
breaking the law. We will find that there are twelve different
combinations possible between the Jones and Smiths of the four
crests specified. If there be an issue of the marriage, we have
heard that the descent always follows the mother’s side, both
as regards family and crest. Consequently, if a Mr. Cat-Jones
marries a Miss Dog-Smith, the child will be a Dog-Smith;
but should the Dog-Smith children again marry into the Cat-Jones’
family-group, the offspring becomes a Cat-Jones if the
child be a boy, but remains a Dog-Smith if a girl.</p>

<p>The north-west central tribes split up each moiety into two
sub-divisions, between which marriages can take place, but the
progeny always goes to the division different from that of its
parents. Let us represent the two pairs of subdivision by A and
B, and C and D respectively. A man of the A group is only
allowed to marry a woman of the B group, and a B-man only
an A-woman. The child resulting from the former union
becomes a member of neither of its parents’ groups, but passes
over to C, and when one from the latter, that is, when the
father is a B-man, becomes a D-member. On the other side,
when a C-man marries a D-woman, the issue returns to the
A line, and when a D-man marries a C-woman, it goes back
to the B. If, for instance, we replace the letters A, B, C, and
D by the words “<i>Pultara</i>,” “<i>Kumara</i>,” “<i>Panunga</i>,” and
“<i>Purula</i>,” in the order specified, we have the general principle
of the Arunndta marriage system.</p>

<p>Among the Minning, the four subdivisions are called
“<i>Tjurrega</i>,” “<i>Menuaitja</i>,” “<i>Kakera</i>,” and “<i>Ngadeja</i>.” Let us
take a simple illustration. A Tjurrega man marries a Menuaitja
woman. A male child is born, which becomes a Kakera.
When he grows up, this Kakera man must marry a Ngadeja<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
woman. The progeny of the last-named union goes back to
the Tjurrega, and, assuming it to be a female, she will have
to marry a Menuaitja, and her child becomes a Ngadeja.</p>

<p>A few tribes of central and north-eastern Australia further
divide each sub-class into two, making eight in all, but fundamentally
the rules governing inter-marriage are much the same
as those just mentioned.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined for one moment that the above
simple outline represents the complete, and, in reality, very
complicated, system upon which the aborigines work. There
are numerous others restrictions, which are more or less variable
according to the locality of any particular tribe. In its broadest
outline, the scheme is much the same all over Australia, and
it is possible therefore for tribes living on a friendly footing
with each other to inter-marry and yet to strictly adhere to the
fundamental principles controlling their respective laws. On
the other hand, it will be realized how easily any white man,
who is in the habit of having indiscriminate intercourse with
native women, can make himself guilty of a criminal offence,
when he cohabits first with a woman of one group and then
with one of another. This applies, of course, only to the
uncorrupted tribes, who still adhere strictly to their ancestral
practices and beliefs.</p>

<p>Occasionally one finds a further splitting up of the intermarrying
divisions, whilst some of the south-eastern tribes
appear to have been without any hard and fast system at all.
Here and there, too, the descent runs in the male line.</p>

<p>A child is generally allotted to its husband early in infancy,
but actual possession is not taken until the girl is of a
marriageable age, that is, when she is about twelve years old.
In the interim, however, the future husband has certain claims
on the child, and can supervise her domestication and instruction.
He, on the other hand, is required to make presentations
to the child’s father and other relatives on the father’s side;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
at this stage, too, he may promise his sister (if she be available)
to his future wife’s brother.</p>

<p>The relationship between man and girl is not a love-affair,
in the modern sense of the word, but the whole transaction is
regarded more like a pure business-matter. The sexual element
plays perhaps the least important role, the man looking upon
the budding woman as his future associate, helpmate and servant,
and also as a valuable asset to his existence wherewith he
might be able to barter. Most of his notions in connection
with barter are potential, and possibly will never be carried out;
in a sense a man’s wealth is gauged by the number of women
he possesses, the younger they are the more valuable. As a
lord of the wilds, it is, indeed, a fortunate position for any
man to be in to own a number of wives; having himself,
as a hunter, to travel unaccoutred, the women become the
machinery of his transport. When in camp, they collect and
prepare food for him, while he is resting or roaming the
woods after game. Moreover, the women assist in the cosmetics
of his person, and are the means of the education of his
children in all matters, except those pertaining to the chase,
warfare, and certain ceremonies taboo to women.</p>

<p>There are, of course, many cases where the habit of association
grows into mutual affection, but one rarely notices the
sacrificing love between man and woman such as is everywhere
apparent between a parent and a child. In the former case the
intercourse is always touched with a suspicion of subserviency
on the part of the woman. Indeed, one cannot fail to be led
to the belief that in their conjugal relationship club-rule is the
dominant factor. One must not suppose that the weaker sex
always submits to this rule without demur or without any
resistance at all. On the contrary, she is usually not backward
in making her voice felt in indignation, even in defiance of the
punishment, which must inevitably, sooner or later, be meted
out to her. Whilst the chastisement is proceeding, the husband<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
prefers to sit aside in dignified silence, with his face turned away
from the querulous gin, until the bombardment of obscene
epithets becomes so strong that he considers drastic intervention
necessary, if for no other reason than in the interests of peace
and the restitution of order in his camp.</p>

<p>In spite of the strict marriage laws, it occasionally happens
that a man elopes with a girl who is outside the permissible
inter-marrying limits. Such elopements are the nearest to a selective
love-match that it is possible to find among the aborigines.
The couple are well aware of the fact that they are committing
a serious offence, and that every effort will be made by the
tribe to capture them so that they may be punished. If they
are caught, both man and girl will be severely battered about
with sticks and clubs, as a result of which either or both may
die. If the man survives, he will be called upon to make heavy
payments of foodstuffs, implements, weapons, ochre, and many
other useful commodities to both the girl’s father and the man
to whom the girl would have passed in the ordinary course of
events. If such couples manage to avoid detection, the fear of
punishment, which awaits them, keeps them from returning
amongst their tribe, and so they might roam about alone or
befriend themselves with a strange tribe, and keep away from
their own people for years, or, perhaps, never return. If the
absconding gin has been married to another, the offence is not
considered so serious. There are, for that matter, usually one
or more women in each tribe who are habitually lax in morals.
These women are scorned by the other members of the tribe,
and are publicly recognized as prostitutes. It goes without
saying that these women are the legal property of some of the
tribesmen, and for that reason any other men, who are not in
the relationship of tribal husbands to the women but cohabit
with them, are more or less ostracized, even to the extent of
total exclusion from any consequential council meetings of the
men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>Apart from these public profligates, the aboriginal women
are laudably loyal to the moral principles which have been
taught them. Ordinarily a woman is true to her individual
husband, but there are certain religious ceremonies during which
other men, who are of the same matrimonial division, may have
legal access to her; these are her tribal husbands.</p>

<p>It is an expression of goodwill and friendship towards a
visitor to offer him one or two of the young married women,
who might live with him during his stay in camp. If the
visitor appreciates the hospitality of the tribe, he receives the
women and, in his turn, offers presents to the old men and to
the husbands of his temporary consorts. A similar consideration
is extended to men who, through a scarcity of the opposite sex
in their particular group, have remained single. Under extraordinary
circumstances, arrangements are very casually made
for a man to associate with a gin who is not of his recognized
class; but in this case it is compulsory to obtain the sanction of
the medicine-man, who, after administering some of his sorcery,
generally consents to the union.</p>

<p>An exchange of wives is not an uncommon event among two
tribesmen, provided always that relationships on both sides are
within the subdivisions allowed to inter-marry by law. This
interchange takes place mostly between childless couples; when
there is a family of young children one generally finds that the
parents remain together until, at any rate, the children have
grown up.</p>

<p>Those groups of a tribal class-organization, which are not
permitted to inter-marry, usually consider themselves in the
position of blood-relatives to each other, that is, as brothers and
sisters, and fathers and mothers; the forbidden groups of their
fathers’ and mothers’ are, however, not necessarily excluded to
the children who look upon the members of those groups as the
brothers and sisters, respectively, of their parents.</p>

</div>

<p>The affairs of a tribe come under the jurisdiction of a small
council of old men who have their discussions in secret conclave,
away from the main camp. Seniority and distinction qualify
a man for admittance to this council, which is controlled by the
strongest personality, much as a prime minister rules over his
cabinet. Questions of importance and concern to the community
are freely debated at these meetings, and when any
decision is arrived at it is placed before a general assemblage
of all male members of the tribe who have attained the rank
of full manhood. At this meeting questions may be asked, but
opposition is immediately squelched and the dissentient ruled
out of order. In any case, it is only a senior man who is
allowed to raise objection; the juniors are required to maintain
a respectful silence, and to listen without interjection. On frequent
occasions the medicine-men, though not necessarily
members of the supreme council, are invited to attend,
especially at such times when the cause of a death is being
investigated, or the nature of adverse climatic conditions such
as a prolonged drought being probed. These are opportunities
at which the sorcerers excel themselves in their wisdom. After
an eloquent address they impress their listeners to such a degree
by the simplest conjuration that their advice is accepted
unreservedly, and is forthwith acted upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>Such is the executive body of the Australian tribes, who
can command, exact punishment, or engage the tribe in warfare.
There is no potentate approaching a royal head who
ascends by either heredity or self-imposed magnificence, but each
tribe has its recognized chief or leader whose position is referred
to as “<i>Ingada</i>” by the Arunndta, “<i>Jingardti</i>” by the Aluridja,
and “<i>Judja</i>” by the Cambridge Gulf natives. The kobong
(or totem) is certainly not without significance, so far as the
personnel of the executive is concerned; any heraldic senior,
if one may so term the position, has a right to represent his
family upon the board of control, and in that capacity his
word is respected. But in addition to the orders of these men,
the natives obey the laws of the tribe, which have been handed
down to them from generation to generation, because they
believe in a supernatural power that will punish them for any
disobedience. This punishment they maintain would take the
form of physical indisposition, disease, or even death, according
to the gravity of the breach. They attribute many cases of
accidental maiming, blindness, deafness, and paralysis to this
cause.</p>

<p>What, perhaps, occupies the attention of the council of old
men most frequently is the arranging of corrobborees, sacred
performances, and initiation ceremonies. Of these the dates
have to be fixed and the programmes discussed and outlined in
detail, so that the men who are to take part in the proceedings
may be in a position to prepare themselves in advance.</p>

<p>In their dealings with the aboriginals, Europeans are too apt
to ignore the authority of the old men, and frequently their
defiance of primal law has led to disastrous conflicts. When
in the MacDonnell Ranges I was desirous of taking two
aboriginal children away with me. The circumstance was
mentioned to one of the influential old men, who thereupon
called together the elders of the tribe; and my request was
considered in all its aspects. After a lengthy meeting, during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
which it was apparent there were two or three dissentient
voices, I was finally informed that the children could accompany
me under certain conditions which I had to take upon
myself to guarantee. This agreement arrived at, the children
were given to understand that they were going by the direction
of the old men, and I officially received the spokesman’s word
of honour that, firstly, the children would never desert us <i>en
route</i>, and, secondly, no attempt would be made on the part of
the tribe to interfere with us, or steal the children from the
camp at night. Had one attempted this under any other conditions
and against the will of the tribe, there would have been
serious trouble.</p>

<p>The natives of Australia have a very good idea of justice,
which they apply in all their transactions among themselves.
If, however, at any time, they find that they have been deceived
or unfairly treated, their sense of righteousness almost spontaneously
turns to revengeful treachery. They are not susceptible
to flattery, and do not look for praise or reward for
any heroic deeds accomplished; to unnecessarily applaud a man
is looked upon as a sign of weakness. On the other hand, when
one has committed a wrong, he expects to be reprimanded, if
not punished, and is disappointed if he receives neither; in fact,
he thinks little of the man who neglects his duty by not making
him suffer for his offence or wrongdoing. A native has a
remarkable memory; and, if once he has escaped chastisement
for taking a liberty with another, he will not think twice of
repeating the wrong, because he does not consider him worthy
of serious consideration. Even should there be resentment upon
a subsequent occasion, he thinks that it needs only a little
cajolery, when the fellow is easily won over on account of
his proven weak character. In this connection his good sense
of humour serves him well; he has a natural gift of being able
to contort the serious in such a way as to make it appear comic,
and, when he wishes, he has a very persuasive tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>Provocation, embarrassment, or terror instinctively and spontaneously
solicits an appeal to the obtruder’s sentiment. The
best example I can tender in this connection is an experience
our party had in the Tomkinson Ranges when it unexpectedly
came upon three women who were cooking a snake. On seeing
the white men in close proximity, two of the gins scampered
off post haste, but the third was so terror-stricken that her legs
refused to move her from the spot. In her bewilderment, however,
she had sufficient presence of mind to think of seizing her
breasts with her hands and squirting fluid in the direction of
the strangers to indicate that she was a mother and on that
account had a special claim to beg for mercy.</p>

<p>There is no denying it, the swarthy inhabitants of Australia
are excellent judges of character, and they seem by instinct
able to explore the trend of thoughts running through each
other’s brains before they are spoken. This faculty is of fundamental
importance to them whilst watching ceremonial dances
and other performances; by means of it they are able to appreciate
when the outsider fails to understand. Moreover (and
this is of considerable importance to the European anthropological
investigator), the moment a native under cross-examination
grasps the nature of questions which are put to him, he
speedily discovers what direction of answer, affirmative or negative,
appears to suit the interrogator best; and accordingly he
will reply. It is, in consequence, absolutely impossible to decide
any matter of importance by soliciting a simple “yes” or “no”
in answer to a leading question. The enthusiasm with which
a biassed reply is tendered is, further, considerably enhanced
by a promised gift or bribe. The significance of these facts,
and their possible consequences, will be realized both in a
scientific and in a legal sense; erroneous impressions may, in the
one case, be gleaned with regard to Australian ethnology, and,
in the other, a fellow may be unconsciously incriminating himself
in the eyes of our law.</p>

<p>Primitive as the natives of Australia are in the scale of
humanity, so they appear to us, from a psychological point of
view, as but mere children. Being intensely emotional, they
are easily moved by rage or grief; they are of a quick temper
and the best of friends fall out over the most trivial matter;
but in the majority of cases the storm lasts but a very short
time and then the friendship is as thick as ever. Happiness
seems the essence of their existence, and indeed none but an
aboriginal could, or would, keep on smiling under the terrible
bondage which our vaunted civilization has imposed upon him.</p>

<p>Among the members composing a tribe, one finds a diversification
of character and talent much the same as builds up a
modern community—it includes orators, warriors, artists, and
clowns. Unauthorized though the action might be, it is not
an uncommon occurrence for a man to place himself in a conspicuous
position in camp and hold forth on matters of current
interest to an enthusiastic and, at times, spell-bound audience;
the man of skill and courage becomes the hero of the hour when
the tribe goes to war; whilst talents in tune or colour are
called upon whenever the occasion demands something out of
the common. Some of the men have the reputation of being
the jesters; their antics and jokes keep the camp in roars of
laughter. Under the last-named category also come the mentally
defective and half-witted persons; they are generally followed
around by a band of mischievous children, who enjoy,
with shameless glee, all the absurd pranks of the imbecile.</p>

<p>Throughout Australia it is required of a person, before he
reaches adolescence, to pass through certain rites and ceremonies,
without which he would not be considered mature and would
not be allowed the privileges enjoyed by the rest of the adult
community. This rule applies to both sexes, and is particularly
stringent in the case of the male; we refer to a series of mutilations,
which are committed by the elders upon the persons of
the rising generation at regular stages of their lives, and always
accompanied by pompous, secret, and demonstrative ceremonial.
These functions naturally vary in different parts of so large an
area as is included in the continent of Australia, but, nevertheless,
the differences are not so considerable that one could not
consider the transactions collectively under the heading of one
and the same chapter.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, the first, and at the same time the least
important, ceremony is the piercing of the lower fleshy portion
of the septum of the nose. This is performed at a rather early
age in the north and south, whilst in central Australia it does
not take place until the child has reached maturity. The
Larrekiya pinch a hole through the flesh with their finger-nails<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
when the child is still in arms. Central tribes use a
sharply-pointed bone or the blade of a spear. The child is
laid flat upon its back and its head placed between the thighs
of the operator, who is kneeling on the ground. The child is
assured that what is about to be done to it will not hurt, and
that, when it is over, its body will develop quickly and become
strong. Then the operator seizes the <i>columna</i> with the index
finger and thumb of his left hand and pulls it well below
the nostrils. With the sharpened piece of bone or blade he
holds in his right hand, he perforates the tissue beneath the
cartilage with a decisive drive, then quickly withdraws the
instrument again. The father, or if the father be dead, the
father’s brother, usually performs the operation upon a boy,
whilst the mother (or mother’s sister) attends to a daughter.
For some time after the operation, the perforation is kept open
by means of a short rod, which is frequently turned about.
Among some of the central Australian tribes, this rite is becoming
obsolete; the Aluridja and Arunndta, for instance, do
not nowadays insist upon the perforation being made at all,
and, if it is, then only late in youth. It is at the option of
a man to perforate the septum of the gin he takes to himself;
if he does so, it is more for vanity sake, thinking that she is
better able to decorate herself for corroborees, than with the
idea of making her grow robust and womanly.</p>

<p>Next in the ritual sequence comes the tooth-rapping ceremony.
This, too, is or was practised practically over the
whole of the continent, and is in parts of great importance,
ranking with certain tribes as one of the initiation steps. The
ceremony extends over weeks and ends with the knocking out
of one or two of the novice’s incisors. Generally a number of
lads or girls undergo the ordeal together; but in the case of
the girls no particularly great fuss is made. At times a number
of adjoining tribes agree among themselves to hold a monster
ceremony conjointly, at which all the youths of correct age are
dealt with. Such is a really big occasion in tribal affairs, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
many weeks are spent in an endeavour to make the event as
successful and as impressive as possible. The decision is made
at one of the council meetings of the old men, who, having
announced the matter to a general assembly, make arrangements
to send invitations to any friendly tribes living around them.
In the Northern Kimberleys of Western Australia, a pair of
men is selected for conveying each invitation to its destination;
they are elaborately painted up and are allowed to wear only
a forehead band and a pubic tassel; each carries a message-stick
and a bull-roarer of a design which is to figure prominently
during the ceremony. The stick and the bull-roarer are to be
given to one of the old men of the tribe they are going to.
When these messengers arrive at their destination, the nature
of their visit is immediately recognized. The old man receives
the stick and bull-roarer and hands them to one of his fellow-councillors
whose crest or “<i>kobong</i>” corresponds to that embodied
in the carvings on the bull-roarer; and, in return, the
messengers are given similar pieces to take back to the sender.
The date for the commencement of the ceremony is fixed about
a month in advance, the half moon being favoured; the trysting
place is upon the originator’s ground at a place where water
and food will be sufficient to supply a great number in attendance
throughout the proceedings. In the meantime the
ground is cleared and prepared; as in most of their initiation
ceremonies, this consists of two large, circular spaces connected
by a straight, wide pathway.</p>

<p>While this is being done, the boys are tended by some old
men, who keep them at a distance and daily talk to them on
matters dealing with manhood’s duties, chivalry, courage, and
the social position of women. In addition, they are taught
some of the principal songs in which they will be required to
join during the subsequent ceremonies in order to please the
old men.</p>

<p>By this time it has become quite clear to the women that
something extraordinary is about to happen. Indirectly they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
are made aware of the fact that a tooth-rapping ceremony
stands near; and then for the first time music is heard; the
women commence chanting periodically to the boys’ teeth, which
they thereby hope to loosen in their sockets.</p>

<p>At this stage a bull-roarer is frequently sounded at night by
one or more old men, who walk quietly away from camp and
conceal themselves in the bush. At the sound of these, the
women are overwhelmed with awe and cover their faces with
their hands and quiver hysterically. This is the dawn of that
period in a young man’s life at which his social status undergoes
a complete change; it is the introduction to the series of
initiation ceremonies which will ultimately qualify him for
acceptance into the inner circle of men who have a voice in the
control of tribal affairs. But more than this: it is also the
beginning of that time in his life when he must learn to sever
himself from his associations with the women and camp apart
from his mother, sisters, and other near female relatives. As a
matter of fact, this event places him on the threshold of a new
life which unfolds to him the secret of the sexes. The sexual
significance of the ceremony is clearly indicated through the
circumstance that both male and female bull-roarers are sounded
during the proceedings, a liberty which is only permitted on
rare occasions.</p>

<p>About two days before the expected arrival of the invited
tribes, rehearsals are held by the local men. A body of the
performers suddenly appears upon the scene, coming from the
cover of the forest; they are all richly decorated with red
ochre and white pipe-clay, and run in a compact line up to
the cleared space. As they approach the spot, they stamp the
ground vigorously and hit their hands together. They halt at
one of the circular spaces, and, whilst they continue to stamp
and beat time with their hands, some of the oldest among them
spring along the track to the opposite space and go through all
sorts of mysterious acting, which include tricks of sorcery
designed to exhort the men and expel any evil spirits from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
ground. The act is repeated every day until the guests arrive,
and then it is also produced at night. The actors, who have
profited by the rehearsals, are now seen at their best, and the
visitors first look on in appreciative bewilderment; at a later
stage, they join in and their own sorcerers display their tricks
as well. This function lasts long into the night, and, should
more visitors arrive, it might be repeated all over again for
the late-comers’ special benefit. During these demonstrations,
the women sit some distance off with their backs turned to the
men and keep up their monotonous tune.</p>

<p>The next few days may be spent in convivial sing-songs and
food-procuring expeditions, whilst the principal performers busy
themselves cutting twigs and leaves from the surrounding trees,
with which they completely cover the cleared ground, so that
not a track remains visible in the sand. The object of this
somewhat tedious process is precautionary, namely, to deny any
prowling spirit the opportunity of ascertaining the identity of
the persons who have taken part in the ceremony. They fear
that, if this information were obtained, the boys would be
molested and their teeth stuck tightly into bone of the gums.</p>

<p>When at last the eventful night arrives, a number of the
older men decorate their bodies profusely with vegetable down
and ochre. The boys’ bodies are smeared with red ochre, over
which certain designs are drawn in symmetrical fashion, and
embodying a number of circles and dashes. The men endeavour
to make themselves as awe-inspiring as possible by concealing
as much of their normal appearance as they can. They keep
aloof from the novices until immediately before the ceremony.</p>

<p>The fires glaring fiercely, the boys are led to the cleared
space and told to keep their eyes closed. Upon a given signal,
several of the decorated men rush from the darkness, pounce
upon the novices, and throw them to the ground. Each man
seizes one of them and kneeling behind him places the lad’s
head upon his lap. The initiate offers no resistance and allows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
his eyes to be covered by the old man’s hands. Whilst some
weird chants are being rendered, the operators appear upon
the scene, each carrying a short cylindrical stick and a stone in
his hands. These men are not decorated and are near relatives
of the boys undergoing the ritual. With much dancing and
gesticulating, they draw near to the boys, and, as each of the
men kneeling behind raises the head of a candidate, one of the
operators steps forward and looks into the boy’s mouth as it
is being forced open by the assistant. Presently he selects his
mark and with his finger-nail presses back the gum from one
of the youngster’s incisors. Then he places the point of his
stick against the tooth and gives it a sharp blow with the stone
he is carrying in his other hand.</p>

<p>As a rule the boy does not whimper, but occasionally one
may give way and cry with pain. This is immediately resented
and forbidden by the old men, who declare that he has been
too much in the company of the women and girls.</p>

<p>The stick is re-applied and another blow imparted to the
tooth; and the process is repeated until the tooth loosens and
falls out. All novices are treated similarly in rotation.</p>

<p>Whilst the elders are continuing their dancing, the boys are
taken back to camp by their initiated male relatives, where they
are presented with a pubic tassel, a dog-tail necklace, or other
article which is strictly peculiar to such as have undergone the
ordeal at the correct time. The boys are again given instructions
in all sorts of matter becoming of a man, among which discipline
and loyalty towards their elders and tribes-people in general
are of first importance. The seriousness of the ceremony then
relaxes somewhat, and songs and dances are produced to inspire
and amuse the boys; the performance rarely concludes before
daylight.</p>

<p>In central Australia the operation is nowadays performed
without much ceremony and usually in daylight. Among the
Wongapitcha it is known as “<i>Antjuarra</i>.” The novice lies on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
his back and rests his head against the operator’s thighs, while
a number of men sit around in a semi-circle (<a href="#plate27">Plate XXVII</a>).
The operator forces the gum away from the tooth with his
finger nails and endeavours to loosen the root in its socket with
a small, pointed wallaby bone he calls “<i>marinba</i>.” Then he
applies the bevelled point of a short, stout rod (“<i>tjutanga</i>”)
and strikes it with a stone (“<i>puli</i>”). The percussion produces
a loud resonant note, at which all present cry “<i>Tirr!</i>” After
four or five whacks with the stone, the tooth falls from its
socket. It is picked up by the operator and shown to the
audience, who respond by exclaiming “<i>Ah</i>” or “<i>Yau</i>.”</p>

<p>The Wongapitcha and western Aluridja remove the left
central incisor; only the eastern groups of the Arunndta still
practise the rite.</p>

<p>One of the chief concerns of an aboriginal father is to make
his son fearless and capable of enduring hardship. In all his
dealings with his children, he endeavours to avoid favouring
and pampering any of them once they have passed out of
infancy; but the boys in particular are constantly urged to
suppress pain and to make it their special task to under-rate
the deprivation of comfort no matter what circumstances might
arise. In the same way the boys are trained to be brave; they
are told not to be under any apprehension of danger except
when it is known to be prompted by the treachery of the evil
spirit or by the wrath of the spirit-ancestors of the tribe. With
this principle ever before them, most of the initiation ceremonies
have been evolved on similar lines. The Kukata even
make it compulsory for the novices to walk through a blazing
fire, an act they refer to as “<i>merliadda</i>.” Other central tribes
make the young men lie temporarily upon branches they place
over a smouldering fire.</p>

</figure>

<p>It is largely during the term of initiation, from early childhood
to adolescence, that every individual, boy or girl, receives
a number of cuts in different parts of the body, which, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
they heal, leave permanent and elevated scars. After the incision
is made, ashes, ochre, and grease are usually rubbed into
the wound to make it granulate to excess and so produce an
artificial keloid. The reasons for making these scars are threefold:
spartan, cosmetic, and tribal. The operation is performed
with a stone-knife or flint-chip. In addition, a punctate scar is
produced by twirling a fire-making stick until it becomes nearly
red-hot, then quickly holding the point against the skin. The
process is repeated time after time, each time selecting a new
point on the skin, until a chain-pattern results. The latter type
of scar is more commonly found on women than on men, and
is much adopted by the coastal tribes of the Northern Territory.</p>

<p>It would be futile even to attempt a scheme of classification
of the different tribal markings. In some districts, only one or
two are made; in others, the better part of the body is covered.
As a general rule, the men display a greater number than the
women; the latter often only have one or two horizontal cuts
across the chest or abdomen, at times, indeed, only a single
prominent scar connecting the breasts. Generally speaking, the
central Australian tribes do not cicatricize their bodies nearly
as much as the northern. The Yantowannta, Ngameni, and
other Cooper Creek natives leave the chest clean above the
breasts, but cut a few horizontal lines immediately below them
on the abdomen; the Dieri add one or two short irregular
marks above; at Durham Downs the women have a number of
short horizontal lines on each breast. Among the Aluridja,
Arunndta, and Arrabonna, one notices principally short horizontal
lines across chest and abdomen, with, occasionally, a few
vertical bars, less than an inch in length, around the shoulders;
a number of the small circular fire-marks are also as a rule
noticeable on the forearms of the Arunndta. On the north
coast a great variety of marks may be studied. The tribes east
and west of Port Darwin have very prominent scars horizontally
across chest and abdomen, short vertical bars around the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
shoulders, sloping bands composed of either parallel vertical
cuts or fire-whisk scars, passing from the central point between
the breasts upwards to the shoulder on one or both sides, and
occasionally a vertical band, consisting of two parallel rows of
fire-whisk scars, on one side of the abdomen just beside the
navel. An additional pattern is a sagging band across the chest
from shoulder to shoulder, consisting of about twenty short
vertical cuts.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that these marks are all regularly
observed upon every individual one meets. On the contrary,
it is very rare to see a person with all the scars referred to,
some having only one or two horizontal lines across the chest
or abdomen like the central tribes.</p>

<p>The Melville and Bathurst Islanders imitate the frond of
the zamia palm (<i>Cycas media</i>) by cutting a series of V-shaped
figures, one within the other, in a vertical row, upon one or
both sides of the back, and on the upper and outer surfaces of
the arms and thighs. Horizontal lines are cut across the chest,
as above described, and here and there a person also has a horizontal
band on his forehead, immediately over the eyes, consisting
of from eight to twelve short vertical cuts.</p>

<p>The Cambridge Gulf natives, both male and female, cut
numerous lines (“<i>gummanda</i>”) horizontally across the chest,
abdomen, buttocks, and thighs, and long vertical lines down
the upper arms, whilst on the back, occasionally, a “waist-band”
or “<i>naualla</i>,” consisting of numerous short vertical nicks, is
added, together with about ten vertical cuts on each calf (<a href="#plate16">Plate
XVI</a>, 2). The gins have one or two vertical bands of punctate
scars between the breasts.</p>

<p>The Worora at Port George IV further decorate the whole
of the back with alternating groups of horizontal and vertical
lines, those on the shoulder blade being particularly prominent.</p>

<p>The central tribes have embodied in the curriculum of initiation
tests a sky-shying act, called “<i>Algerrigiowumma</i>” by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Arunndta, during which the novice is tossed high into the air
by a number of older men. The ceremony is somewhat as
follows. By agreement, a crowd of men and women assemble
at night upon a cleared piece of ground near the camp-fires.
After a few songs and ordinary dances, whose object seems to
be more to create an atmosphere than that they have any
definite significance from an initiation point of view, the whole
congregation draws up in one or two lines and settles down to
a peculiar dance, shuffling sideways from one edge of the cleared
space to the other and back again. As they move they mumble
a verse of coarse guttural words which ends in hissing notes
resembling the panting of a vicious animal. At this moment
two or three men spring from behind and seize the unsuspecting
novice. Rushing towards the expectant crowd, they swing him
high above their shoulders and throw him among the outstretched
arms of the crowd. There he is seized by a dozen or
more of the most powerful men, who toss him high up towards
the sky. During his flight through the air the position of the
boy is usually horizontal. When he returns again by gravitation,
he is caught and once more projected skywards; and the
same process is repeated time after time. He may then be
released, but if the crowd again begin to dance and sing, he
will in all probability have to submit to a repetition. The
ceremony amounts to a formal handing over of the boy by the
women to the care of the men.</p>

<p>Of momentous importance is the initiation ceremony which
includes the circumcision of the novice; it is the first occasion
upon which the truth of growing manhood is definitely made
clear to the boy. The Aluridja refer to the ceremony as
“<i>Arrarra</i>”; it extends over a period of several days, during
which wild dances and songs are produced. For weeks before
the novices are zealously guarded by certain of the old men
and kept away from the mixed camp. No women are tolerated
within a wide radius of the spot at which the ritual event is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
to be celebrated; and throughout the vigil the boys remain out
of sight of their female relatives and are allowed to converse
with none but their guardians. The boys’ diet is restricted to
only a few very ordinary items, amounting to a mere sustenance;
anything they are able to obtain by assiduous hunting is required
to be handed to the men in charge. After having listened to
the songs of the men officiating in the ceremony, the boys are
allowed on the second or third night to attend in person. They
are given to understand that what they are about to see is never
to be explained to any of the women or juniors. The performance
must be regarded as sacred and most secret; and they
must realize that, although invisible, there are many ghost-ancestors
present who are following every item of the ceremony
with proud appreciation. At such a stage the performers are
awe-inspiring spectacles, being richly decorated with white and
red down and wearing the cross-shaped “<i>Wanningi</i>” in their
hair (<a href="#plate43">Plate XLIII</a>, 2).</p>

<p>A great fire is burning at the edge of a cleared space, around
which a number of men are sitting and singing and beating the
ground with sticks. To the listener the strains sound respectful,
if not worshipful; in the Aluridja they run somewhat like:
“<i>Imbinana alla’m binana</i>,” repeated almost indefinitely. In
the glaring light it is noticed that the ground is cleared of the
original grass and growth, but is covered with a layer of leaves
of the red gum tree which abounds along the watercourses.
Upon this matting of leaves the dancers are moving to and fro,
madly stamping the ground. Then, as they quicken their pace,
each places the point of his beard into his mouth and tries to
look as ferocious as possible. The lead is taken by one who is
carrying a short hooked stick in front of him. In single file
these men encircle the chorus, the leader touching all present
with his crook and shrieking “<i>Arr, arr, aah!</i>”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="plate31" style="max-width: 43.75em;">

</figure>

<p>The novice (or novices, as the case may be) is now taken
away from the wild scene and again given to understand that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
henceforth he is not to leave the company of the men, and that
he must do as those in authority bid him. He is taken to
another fire some distance off and covered with red ochre from
head to foot; his hair is tied back with human hair-string; then
he is led back to the principal group of performers.</p>

<p>When he re-appears, the dancers rush around in the manner
described above, crying “<i>Arr, arr, aah!</i>” with husky voices, first
more or less confusedly, but gradually in a more defined line
which gradually closes upon the youth. Beyond themselves
with excitement, they lay hands upon the lad and lift him upon
the backs of two or three of the men who are stooping in
readiness to receive him. As he is carried onwards, the other
performers, and some of the chorus as well, cluster around the
panic-stricken boy, each of them taking hold of some part of his
body and helping to make the mass of humanity as confused as
possible (<a href="#plate29">Plate XXIX</a>, 2). Thus they tour around the cirque
and pull up near to the fire. Two or three of the number now
throw themselves beneath the carriers, who, in their turn, immediately
pile themselves upon them. The boy is pulled back on to
this human operating table full length, and another man immediately
jumps on to his chest; others hold him securely by his
arms and legs. All the time the men keep up their cries of
“<i>Arr!</i>” and from different places around the fire the booming,
humming, and shrieking notes of bull-roarers rise above the din.</p>

<p>The moment the latter unearthly sounds are heard at a
Kukata ceremony, the men respond with an uproarious slogan
sounding like: “<i>Wubbi, wubbi, wubbi, wau!</i>” This imitates
the noise of the bull-roarer, which is supposed to be the voice
of the presiding spirit. A perceptible wave of solemnity pervades
the atmosphere at this moment, not only in the immediate
surroundings of the ceremonial fire, but wherever the piercing
chorus strikes the ears of camping groups, who may at the time
be many miles away. Women and children shudder with fright
and bury their faces in their hands. The initiated men, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
act differently. Where there is only one in camp, he
rushes to the fireside and snatches a burning stick which he
tosses high into the air. When there are several present, they
rush out together into the darkness and unitedly echo the
“<i>Wubbi, wubbi, wubbi, wau!</i>”</p>

<p>The boy’s mouth is gagged with a ball of hair-string, which
serves the double purpose of stifling his voice, should he attempt
to cry, and of giving him something to bite his teeth into when
he is in pain.</p>

<p>The men at the lower end now force his legs asunder and
press them downwards over the side of the bodies below. As
this is happening, the operator walks into the space between the
thighs, with his beard between his lips and his eyes rolling in
their sockets. He carries a knife in his hand—usually a fair-sized
freshly broken splinter of quartzite, chalcedony, flint, or
quartz, with or without a handpiece of resin—and immediately
proceeds to operate. The Wongapitcha at this stage stun the
boy by clubbing his head. With his left hand the surgeon
seizes the prepuse, whilst a veritable reverberation of short-sounded
“<i>i, i’s</i>” meets him from the mouths of all present, and
as he draws it well forward a number of hacks severs it (<a href="#plate30">Plate
XXX</a>). The Dieri make use of a short, smooth, cylindro-conical
stone, over the rounded point of which the operator
stretches the skin, and so pushes back the glans before he cuts.</p>

<p>Among the Kukata the circumcision ceremonial is referred to
as “<i>Gibberi</i>.” During its period, cicatrices are made on the
arms, but the characteristic transverse cuts on the back are
reserved for the following rite, which goes by the name of
“<i>Winyeru</i>.” The prepuse is resected with a stone knife known
as “<i>tjulu</i>,” and immediately destroyed by throwing it into the
fire.</p>

<p>As the surgeon’s hand leaves the boy’s body with the detached
skin clutched between two fingers, the act is greeted all round
with an appreciative exclamation sounding like “<i>A ha, a hm</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
The Aluridja refer to the skin as “<i>banki</i>,” and bury it shortly
after the operation.</p>

<p>The boy, who by this time is usually semi-comatous, is sat up,
and the blood which is streaming from him is collected in a
piece of bark previously laid beneath him. The Wogait and
other northern tribes subsequently dress the wound with paperbark,
clay, emu fat, and hot ashes, to stanch the bleeding.
When the boy recovers from the shock, he is presented with a
spear and spear-thrower, and often a shield as well.</p>

<p>The patient is then taken into the bush to convalesce; and
during this period his diet is under strict observation. After
about three weeks he has more or less recovered and returns
with the men to the main camp, wearing a fur-tassel which
covers his pubes. His mother and other near female relatives
on the mother’s side, when they behold him, walk towards him
sobbing, tearing hair from their scalps and otherwise hurting
their bodies as indication of their sympathy for the painful
ordeal he has so bravely undergone whilst aspiring towards the
status of manhood.</p>

<p>Cases have repeatedly come under my notice in latter years
where a circumcision candidate has attempted to evade the
operation by travelling away from his tribe and residing indefinitely
with some other party, native or European, having
no jurisdiction over him. It is usually only a matter of time
and he will be ambushed by men of his own tribe and taken
back to camp. The operation is then immediately performed,
and is made extraordinarily drastic as a punishment. The skin
is stretched forward under considerable tension and severed
with a stone knife. In several specimens which are in my
possession, the external sheath was cut so high up that a number
of pubic hairs were removed with it.</p>

<p>This ceremony in its essential features is much the same
among all tribes which circumcise, although there are slight
variations in the method of building up the human operating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
table. In the Wogait tribe, for instance, the boy is thrown on
his back over the legs of four men who sit in pairs, face to
face, with their limbs alternately placed so that the feet of one
are against a thigh of another.</p>

<p>We have already referred to the ceremonial object known as
the “<i>wanningi</i>,” which is produced during this ceremony.
This is always constructed specially for the occasion and is destroyed
again immediately after; under no circumstances are the
women and children allowed to see it, for if they did blindness
or some paralysing affliction would strike them for their disobedience.
In its simplest form, the “<i>wanningi</i>” consists of a
cross, from the centre of which a long twine of fur is wound
spirally outwards, from arm to arm, and fastened with a single
turn round each arm in succession. The object is either stuck
into the hair as referred to, or carried in the hand by the functionaries
during the final stage of the ceremony. In the northern
Kimberleys a similar structure is used which is carried at
the end of a spear or long stick behind the back of the performer.
The “<i>wanningi</i>” is supposed to become inspired by a
spirit guardian the moment the object is completed and prevents
the boy from suffering too great a loss of blood. It is shown
to the boy just prior to the operation and its sacred nature is
explained to him.</p>

<p>The partially matriculated man now remains in camp for a
while, but is kept under the strictest surveillance and aloof from
the opposite sex. He continues to go out on daily excursions
with certain of the older men and has to recompense those who
took an active part in his initiation with the lion-share of his
hunting bag, many items of which he is himself still forbidden
to partake of.</p>

<p>Not many weeks pass by peacefully, however, before the excitement
starts afresh. An old man, usually the senior among
the initiate’s group-relatives, quite spontaneously lays hands on
the unsuspecting neophyte, by clutching him between his arms,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
and bites him on the head. Then he releases him again and
darts away like one possessed. Others take the cue and act
similarly. Several men participate in this painful but well-intentioned
ceremonial, and they may repeat the performance
from three to six times in succession. The youth tries to make
light of the injury done him but often cannot altogether suppress
crying with agony. The blood pours freely from the
numerous wounds in his scalp. He will in all probability have
to undergo this painful ordeal on two or three different occasions.</p>

<p>There is yet another big test to be passed by the man-in-the-making
before he is finally admitted by the controlling council
to mature membership. And this is again accompanied by an
additional mutilation of his person, which is commonly referred
to as the “mika operation.” With few exceptions it is performed
by most of the central and north-western tribes and in
much the same manner.</p>

<p>The ceremony does not take place until some time after the
young man has thoroughly recovered from the effects of his previous
sufferings. It follows, in many instances, as the natural
climax to a lengthy religious demonstration during which a
series of sacred songs and dances has been produced. Needless
to say the proceedings are inaugurated at a spot remote from
the general camping ground, and preference is given to a moonlight
night. No woman or child is tolerated near, and the
novice is told that he must regard his presence among the old
men as a decided favour. Ordinary songs are rendered for a
while which are designed to fecundate the mother-stocks of
their game supplies; then follow more dramatic incantations
which are believed not only to attract certain spirit-ancestors
to the spot but also inspirit the sacred but ordinarily inanimate
tjuringas which are lying before the celebrants at the fireside.
The excitement grows and with it the men wax enthusiastic.
It is decided to operate upon one or more young men who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
happen to be available; and now everybody seems beyond himself
with frenetical animation. The suggestion is received
with applause. No secret is made about the matter; and the
nomination is made in public. The atmosphere is so tense with
hysterical veneration that the mere mention of a likely function
enjoining the spilling of blood is received with enthusiasm and
general appreciation. Arrangements are made forthwith.</p>

<p>Three or four men who are to be intimately concerned in
the affair dodge into the darkness of the bush and return a short
time later besmeared with ochre and pipeclay, and decorated
with eagle-hawk’s down. As they approach the fire, they stamp
the ground with their feet and balance their arms in a horizontal
position. Thus they encircle the fire two or three times
and, in doing so, make a peculiar hissing noise like that produced
when wood is being cut. All the time the other men
are beating time to the movements of the performers by smacking
their hands against their buttocks.</p>

<p>Presently the dull, humming sound of a bullroarer breaks
upon the performers’ ears. At this, all men throw up their
arms above their heads and yell, while the notes of the bullroarer
reach a higher pitch. A jumble of wild, vociferating
men ensues. The novice stands in their midst. The bullroarer’s
noise is stopped, and with it the voices of the men
die away. Only the painted performers continue to stamp and
again make the peculiar hissing noise as they move around the
fire. By this time a number of men have placed themselves behind
the novice who is made to stare into the brightest portion
of the fire and told not to move his eyes from the spot.</p>

<p>Upon a significant nod or other signal from the leading performer,
some of the men at the back of the youth lie upon the
ground, while others place themselves on top of them again.
The moment this has happened, the youth is tripped backwards
over them by some who have been standing at his side, and
by them he is also held down and gagged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>The leading performer now moves straight towards the victim
and in his hand one notices he is carrying a stone cutting
knife. His attendants spring to each side of him and hold the
young man’s legs apart. Now the leading man, who has been
ordained with the surgical duties, follows the ancient practice
of the “gruesome rite” by splitting the urethra for a distance of
about an inch down its length. The withdrawal of the surgeon
from the scene meets with the approval of all participants
and eye-witnesses; and this fact is made known by the combined
exclamations of “<i>A, A, Yah!</i>”</p>

<p>The young man is promptly pulled up from the improvised
living table and his gag removed. He is ordered to sit over a
wooden receptacle, usually a shield but occasionally a food-carrier,
in which the blood pouring from the wound is allowed to
collect. In a crude but hearty manner, more by action than
by word, he is congratulated. Now he is a man, a real man,
and he is at liberty to join in the discussions of the rest of
the men and to ask any pertinent questions relating to the
affairs of his tribe.</p>

<p>During this time the commotion around the camp-fire continues
without abatement. The excited throng, spurred on by
what has preceded, seems to have become intoxicated by the
sight of blood. The men who lay beneath the initiate during
the operation figure prominently among them and display the
clots and congealed patches of blood which cover considerable
portions of their naked bodies. This provokes an appetite for
seeing more and ere long one of the senior men, who has
been initiated some time ago, volunteers to have the subincision
of his urethra extended. He of his own free will calls upon
an old man to perform on him and, when the nominee steps
forward, he submits to the torture without flinching. Others
follow his example. There is no doubt that the brave demonstration
of masculine fearlessness stimulates the newly initiated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
member who is sitting aside and recovering from the shock
which the trying ordeal has given his system.</p>

<p>The Kukata men at this stage, knowing that the candidate
has now successfully passed the second great initiation rite,
known as “<i>Winyeru</i>,” and is henceforth to be allowed to mix
with the women, betray extreme sensual excitement. And it is
whilst they are in that state that some of the oldest men approach
them, carrying spears, with the points of which they extend
the previous slit in the urethra by a further short distance.
It is only natural that the blood which follows the cut is
squirted in considerable quantity. The custom is to allow it
to do so until the excitement abates, and then to stop the
bleeding by holding a fire-stick near the wound. After submitting
themselves to such treatment on numerous successive
occasions, it could only be expected that the whole external
length of the urethra is eventually slit. The old men maintain
that thereby their carnal powers are increased, and for that
reason their forefathers introduced the corresponding female
operation.</p>

<p>The after-treatment of the patient is much the same as described
in connection with the circumcision ceremony. When
eventually the newly made “man” returns to the main camp,
a great sensation is caused among the women who wail as if
there had been a bereavement, and cut deep gashes into different
parts of their bodies.</p>

<p>Many of the northern coastal tribes, such as the Wordaman
of the Wickham and Victoria Rivers, erect a sacred pole at the
site of the enactment of some of their religious and initiation
ceremonies. This pole is called “<i>Djundagalla</i>” and stands six
or seven feet high. It is painted in alternate bands of black
and white, occasionally red and white, and resembles a barber’s
pole more than anything. The “<i>Djundagalla</i>” stands in the
centre of the cleared space and the rites are performed around<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
it. In the northern Kimberleys, we find a stone phallus taking
the place of the pole.</p>

<p>It is not every tribe that submits its young men to these
mutilations at the initiation ceremonies. There are some which
institute great graduation-festivals without the infliction of
bodily harm to the virile aspirants. Notably among these are
the Larrekiya, Melville Islanders, and the tribes living along
the coast from the King River to the heads of the Roper and
East Alligator Rivers.</p>

<p>As an illustration of a tribe which celebrates the coming of
manhood without resorting to operative measures, the Larrekiya
perhaps serve best. The boy, when definite signs of adolescence
manifest themselves, is decorated with the kapok of the silk
cotton-tree (<i>Bombatt malabaricum</i>) and birds’ down. A straight
band passes below his eyes from ear, and the ends thereof are
connected by means of a horseshoe-shaped figure traversing the
cheeks and having its closed end at the chin. Another horizontal
band extends from shoulder to shoulder, above the
nipples, and from this two symmetrical lines are constructed
down the abdomen and on to the thighs, where each terminates
in a circular band around the knee. A white line
is also drawn down the outer surface of each upper arm and
is made to end in the plaited armlets worn above the elbow.
His forehead is decorated with a broad band consisting of a
number of parallel strands of opossum fur thickly besmeared
with white pipeclay; in the middle of this is stuck a plume of
emu or heron feathers, and fur-tassels pend from either side
of it. He also wears a coiled bark belt and, over it, a human
hair girdle supporting a large pubic tassel.</p>

<p>The initiates are made to sit in a row before the old men and
are instructed to keep their eyes closed with their hands. The
old men stamp the ground wildly and brandish their spears
poised in the spear-throwers. Every now and then they utter
harsh cries of “<i>Arr-re! Arr-re!</i>” and “<i>Gora!</i>” Whilst this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
pandemonium is in full swing, the boys are ordered to open
their eyes and behold their elders performing; then they are
led away into the bush and have to wait on the men, having
especially to collect for them many things that are good to
eat. During this period they are often cowed by being struck
between the shoulder-blades, and threatened with violence if at
any time they talk publicly about anything that has transpired
or in any way betray the trust which the old men have placed
in them. Upon their return to camp, the young men have
additional scars cut into the skin of their chest and are then
entitled “<i>Böllier</i>” which signifies that the first stepping stone to
maturity has been passed.</p>

<p>A second ceremony takes place some years later. Each youth
is then under the individual charge of an old man and is decorated
much the same way as the Böllier candidate described
above, with the distinguishing features of four red ochre stripes
across the white forehead band and an extra plume of white
cockatoo feathers stuck into his hair. The proceedings start
soon after sundown and last till about midnight; they include
much gesticulation and vociferation. At the solemn moment
when the “conferring” of the maturity-degree takes place, the
youth, still tended by the old man, remains motionless, with
downcast eyes, and listens to the melancholy chant rendered by
the old men in low lagging accents:</p>

<p>“<i>Makolär manga, malolär, ä, är, maklär, immanga.</i>”</p>

<p>No beating of sticks or clapping of hands accompanies this tune,
and no further ceremonial dance follows.</p>

<p>The youth has now been elevated to the status of “<i>Mollinya</i>”
which qualifies him to the full rank and privileges of
manhood. Further cicatrices may now be added to either side
of his abdomen. The cuts are horizontal but do not extend
right up to the median line.</p>

<p>During the period intervening between Böllier and Mollinya
festivals, bustard, flying-fox, and yam are forbidden articles of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
diet, but after the latter event the fledgelings are invited to
eat with the old men. They honestly believe that if any of the
young men, while undergoing initiation, ate one of the forbidden
articles secretly, the medicine man would be able to detect
the food in his stomach; and having thus disobeyed, the
medicine man would be justified in running a spear through the
offender, or at any rate compel him to swallow certain things
which would poison him. These rules are strictly observed,
and, whenever some of the privileged members have eaten flying-fox
or bustard, they take the precaution to collect the bones
and burn them.</p>

<p>The tribes on Nullarbor Plains will tell you that the initiation
ceremonies originated in the following way. Many,
many years ago, the emu and the kangaroo were more or less
human in appearance and possessed of mighty powers. One
day the emu caught the kangaroo with the object of making a
man of it. But the great struthious bird had no hands wherewith
it might have performed an operation; all it possessed was
a “finger” on each side of its body. It might be explained
that the emu, because it cannot fly, is not regarded as a “bird”
in the generally recognized sense, and consequently the wings are
looked upon as “fingers.” In most of the vocabularies, indeed,
no distinction is made between “finger” and “hand,” the south-western
tribes of central Australia referring to one or the other
as “<i>marra</i>.” Nothing daunted, however, the emu removed the
<i>præputium</i> from the kangaroo by clutching it between its wings
and pulling it off. Thereupon the emu said to the kangaroo:
“Will you make me a man?” And the kangaroo replied, “Yes.”
The kangaroo had the advantage over the emu because it possessed
five “fingers,” with which it could perform the operation
the right way. The animal caught hold of the bird and
circumcised it with a sharp splinter of flint. But the emu
requested to be further operated upon and so it came about that
the kangaroo decided upon a subincision. To the present day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
the emu retains the marks of this operation. Some while after
these happenings, the tribal fathers ran across the sacred emu
and noted the change in its anatomy; they forthwith mutilated
each other in a similar way, and only then did they realize
that they were men.</p>

<p>Not boys alone are required to submit to the various initiation
ceremonies here mentioned, but in most tribes young
women are “made” marriageable by having to submit themselves
to ordeals which are quite similar to those of manhood’s
approbation.</p>

<p>While discussing the female breast, we noted that when it
begins to develop a girl is taken away by the men and the
breast anointed and sung to, to stimulate its growth. This
procedure is the forerunner of initiation. The girl’s development
is forthwith watched with care, and when the unmistakable
signs of ripening are detected the event is celebrated with
dance and song.</p>

<p>Men and women attend, and the items rendered are more
or less of the nature of an ordinary corrobboree, although occasionally
some special feature characterizes the performance.
For instance the Larrekiya and Wogait tribes pass the girl
through a “smoking” ceremony after the following fashion. An
old gin places herself behind the girl and lays her hands upon
the latter’s shoulders. Then all the other women taking part
form a continuous chain by standing in a single row behind each
other and “linking up” in a similar way. They begin to sing
“<i>Ya, Ya, Ya</i>,” in a long-drawn melancholy note, and the old-gin
immediately stamps her feet, and, moving forwards, pushes
the girl along in front of her. All the other performers
follow her, stamping in unison and holding on to the shoulders
of the person in front. Quite unexpectedly the monosyllabic
“<i>Ya</i>” is changed to “<i>Yen da min</i>,” and at this the old gin stops
short and strikes the girl’s back thrice with her hand. The
same performance is repeated time after time during the night.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
Early in the morning of the next day, the girl is led to the
sea, and the whole party wades out to about hips’ depth. Here
a grotesque dance is started during which they strike their
arms, bent in the elbows, against the sides of their bodies under
water, the splash producing a peculiar hollow-sounding note.
The process reminds one of a goose flapping its wings while
enjoying a bath. At this stage, the wording of the song
sounds like “<i>A-lö-lö-lö</i>,” and when its final syllable has resounded,
all bathers duck under the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Next a fire is kindled upon the shore, and, when a good
blaze has been obtained, a heap of grass and leaves previously
steeped in water, is piled upon it. Upon this the old gin seats
herself and makes the girl sit upon her lap facing her and with
her legs astride. The volumes of smoke which are generated
completely hide the two from view. The idea is to allow the
smoke to thoroughly play upon the parts of the novice, the
process being facilitated by the manipulation of the old gin.
When the ceremony is concluded, the girl is led into the bush
by the old women and for some time to follow she is not allowed
to partake of certain articles of diet, such as for instance
snake, dugong, and goanna.</p>

<p>Several of the northern and north-eastern coastal tribes
mutilate the hand of a young gin during the period of her
initiation by removing two joints from a finger. The forefinger
of either hand is generally chosen by the former tribes,
the latter favouring the small finger. The Ginmu at the mouth
of the Victoria River make the amputation with a stone knife.
In this district a singular case came under my notice which is
of considerable interest from an evolutional point of view since
it suggests a phenomenon usually only met with in crustations,
reptiles, and other creatures whose position is very much lower
in the animal kingdom. A young girl had had two end
phalanges of a finger imperfectly removed, and yet upon the
mutilated stump a horny growth resembling a diminutive finger-nail<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
had formed anew. The Daly River tribes remove the
bones by tying a ligature of cobweb which they find in the
mangroves very tightly around the joint. The end phalanges
of the finger, thus deprived of the circulation, gradually mortify
and drop off. Occasionally the joints may be bitten off by a
parent of the child.</p>

<p>As a general rule, it may be said that wherever mutilations
of the male are undertaken during initiation ceremonies, a corresponding
operation is performed upon the female; and, <i>vice
versa</i>, where the former practice is not indulged in, the latter
is also unknown. Generally speaking, too, the female mutilation
ceremonies are much the same wherever practised in Australia,
but the implements or devices employed for the actual
mutilation vary in different localities.</p>

<p>Invitations to the event are sent by special messengers to adjoining
groups and neighbouring friendly tribes. These messengers
are of mixed sexes and are decorated by having their
bodies covered with ochre. The common method is to make
the ground colour of the body a rich red and to draw upon it
concentric circles of white and black. The men carry a “female”
tjuringa, whilst the women, apart from numerous necklaces
and armlets which they wear, are unaccoutred. The
latter are near group-relatives of the young woman concerned.
Their mission is readily understood by the people they look
up during their walk-about, and, without much interchange
of words, acceptance is indicated by the recipients of the message
by resorting to an intimacy with the feminine emissaries.
Although considerable liberality is shown during this indulgence,
the privilege is by no means stretched to beyond the
bounds of a tolerable promiscuousness, even though the messengers
may be entertained at the distant camp for two or three
days before they return home.</p>

<p>The celebrating camp in the interim has been busily preparing
for the approaching event. Nightly corrobborees have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
been held at the chosen spot by both the men and the women,
and the novice has repeatedly appeared before the performing
crowd richly decorated and besmeared with emu-fat and ochre.
At no time, however, even after the invited guests have arrived,
does the excitement become anywhere near as great as during
the initiation ceremonies of the opposite sex; in fact, at its
best, the performance is extremely dull and monotonous.</p>

<p>When at length it becomes apparent that even the principal
actors themselves are tiring, it seems as though the moment had
arrived when only a desperate decision could revive the enthusiasm.
A number of men, who stand in the same group-relationship
to the novice as her future husband, lead the girl
away without any ado, except perhaps that the remaining
members slightly spur their acting. This stage is mostly
reached at daylight, as often as not early in the morning, after
the whole night has been spent in dancing and singing.</p>

<p>Away from the din of her tribespeople’s celebration in
honour of the occasion of her stepping from girlhood to womanhood,
the silent victim is told to squat on the ground whilst the
men surround her. Her oldest “group-husband” produces a
flat, wooden tjuringa, of the “male” type, with which he several
times touches her person, whilst he mutters incoherent and
garbled words. This is done to dispel from her all possible
pain and likely loss of blood during the operation she is about
to be submitted to.</p>

<p>Then she is requested to lie flat on her back, and her head
is placed upon the lap of one of the men who squats to keep it
there. It follows the act which is destined to make her marriageable;
her virginity is doomed to mechanical destruction.</p>

<p>The instruments, if any, which are used for the operation
vary according to locality. In the central areas (Aluridja,
Wongapitcha, Kukata), an ordinary stone-knife with resin haft
is used. The Victoria desert tribes employ cylindro-conical
stones from six to eight inches long, and from one and a half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
to two inches in diameter. Among the tribes of the northern
Kimberley districts of Western Australia no real instrument is
used at all, but the operator winds the index and middle fingers
of his right hand together with a long piece of fur-string; and
this device answers the same purpose as the above-named instruments.</p>

<p>The tribes indulging in this practice admit that their action
is prompted by a desire to offer the girl’s pudicity to one of
her spirit-husbands. We might indeed look upon this rite as
the equivalent of sacrificing the <i>jus primae noctis</i> to a mythical
or legendary tribal relative who is supposed to be living in the
astral form and who is likely to come back to earth at any day.</p>

<p>It has often been written that the Australian aboriginal is
without religious ideas and without religious ceremonies. Such
assertions are grossly incorrect and by no means portray the
psychological side of the primitive man in its true light. He
has, on the contrary, religious institutions and obligations which
verge on the basis of all modern conceptions and recognition
of divine supremacy. If we can class Nature-worship, Ancestor-worship,
and Sex-worship as the beginnings of all religious
teachings, then the Australian aboriginal has certainly inherited
by instinct and tradition a very solid foundation from
which we might trace the origin of many, if not most, of our
most sacred beliefs in Christianity. At the same time, it must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
not be forgotten that it is really a difficult matter to distinguish
clearly between mythological beliefs and what we class as religion.
Religious thought has fluctuated with the advance of
civilization and science to such a degree that, even within the
short space of time covered by the more reliable records of our
history, several revolutionary modifications have come about.
As time advances, man becomes more sceptical and more exacting
in his demand for proofs, and in his despair over finding
nothing tangible to worship, he resorts to the recognition, by
instinct or persuasion, of a God who is a Spirit. But all the
while, as this secular metamorphosis is proceeding, he keeps his
innermost feelings and faith alive by appealing to his knowledge
of the gospel or his belief in salvation, in the manner it
was presented to him by myth, by legend, or by the Scriptures.
His principal guide is his intellect; the less it is trained
the stronger his inherited conviction; the more scientific it becomes,
the greater his desire to probe the truth.</p>

<p>The modern man has so accustomed himself to an artificial
environment that he takes the so-called “elements” of Nature,
especially water and fire, in a strictly matter-of-fact sort of
way. But the primitive man, who realizes that his very existence
is dependent upon these factors, has learned to respect,
preserve, and worship them as legacies he imagines to have been
left him by some of his illustrious forbears who, he supposes,
have gone to an unknown realm where they live in peace and
can only return temporarily to their former haunts in the invisible
form or through the medium of some other object which
is related to the individual in some mysterious way.</p>

<p>The aboriginal looks upon fire as one of the great indispensible
quantities of his social existence; it is the element which
dispels the evil spirits from his camp; it is the means by which
comfort and friendship are made accessible to him; it is his
universal companion. More than this, it is the fire, with its
warmth and its light, which draws individuals, families, groups,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
and tribes together and through its agency and influence that
social concourse is established which lies at the bottom of all
conviviality, oracular discussion, and ceremony. How well this
sentiment agrees with the knowledge we possess of the origin
of civilization! Indeed the appreciation of fire together with
the knowledge of its preservation is perhaps the mightiest factor
responsible for making our species human. Once man learned
to nurse an original flame he found through accidental cause
and kept it constantly by his side, his progress became an established
fact. His crude camp-fire talks developed into discussions
which he further expanded by means of drawings on
the walls of caves he occupied. The free exchange of thought
brought about by congregation round the cheerful flame could
not fail to incite the intellect; and thus he ascended to the high
road of civilization and gathered the fruits of culture he now
enjoys.</p>

<p>The Aluridja, Wongapitcha, and some of the north-western
coastal tribes believe that many years ago, a party of ancestral
creatures, more animal than human, came down from the sky
through the branches of tall gum-trees to confer with the spirits
which roam about at night and conceal themselves in inanimate
objects during the day. These monsters brought a fire-stick
with them and when they reached the earth, they lit a fire to
cook some grubs which they had taken from the bark of the
trees during their descent. As they were feasting, the spirits
called them and they went with them to a cave where the bones
of the persons rested, originally occupied by the spirits themselves.
Whilst they were away, the fire which had been left
unguarded, decided to run into the bush and, being in a mischievous
mood, started an enormous blaze which burned down
much of the forest and the tall gum-trees as well. The spirit-ancestors
and the heavenly monsters beheld the disaster with
consternation and called upon the fire to come back. This it
did. But it so happened that some of the tribes’ fathers were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
hunting in the area, and when they saw the fire, which was
strange to them, they snatched portion of it away and ran with
it to their camp, where they kept it and fed it with dry grass
and sticks. The spirits and their visitors were very angry and
never left the fire out of their sight, lest it might abscond again;
they were compelled to live on earth for a very long time until
the trees grew up again to their lofty domain. The hunters,
on the other hand, zealously guarded their prize fearing that
it might run away from them. Even to the present day, this
belief exists among the older folks, and they always take great
care that the ground is cleared of inflammable matter to stop
the fire from bolting; to be on the safe side, they invariably
carry or keep near to them a fair-sized, glowing fire-stick.</p>

<p>Among the Minning this legend is circulated in a slightly
modified form. Two ancestral spirits had their fires burning in
the sky at points represented by the pointers of the Southern
Cross constellation, when one day they decided to come down
to the earth to hunt opossum. They took their fires with them,
but while engaged in the chase they left them at their camp.
When they had obtained a sufficient number of opossums to
make a good meal, they returned to their camp, where they
noticed six young men sitting around the fires, who immediately
made off, and, in doing so, each took a fire-stick away with him.
The spirits gave chase and re-captured five of the thieves, but
the sixth, who was named “<i>Warrupu</i>,” reached the camp of his
tribe and handed the fire-stick to his mother, “<i>Wenoinn</i>.” The
woman ran with it to the white sand hills about Eucla in
which she intended hiding it. But the spirits had noticed her
and came towards her from above with a spear. In her predicament,
the woman threw the fire-stick away, which immediately
set the whole of the country ablaze between Eucla and Israelite
Bay. All the tribes were thus enabled to seize some of the
fire which they have carefully watched over ever since.</p>

<p>A similar tradition is perpetuated by the north-western tribes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
referred to and affords the motive of one of the most earnest
and sacred fire-ceremonies known in Australia. The performance
takes place during the night. It is introduced by two
men; the one represents a mischievous spirit trying to steal back
the sacred fire which is being carefully guarded by a number
of men impersonating the ancestral tribesmen who originally
discovered it; the other is a warrior who has accidentally come
upon the would-be thief and overpowered him. The spirit
crouches at the feet of the warrior, sitting upon his heels, with
his head drooping upon his chest and his hands hanging loosely
between his thighs. The warrior stands erect behind his supposed
captive, with his legs apart, and continues striking the
fellow with small bundles of brushwood, one of which he holds
in either hand. The beating is done regularly, both hands rising
simultaneously, high above the warrior’s head, and falling
together upon the spirit’s head.</p>

<p>Some two chains away, the tribal ancestors are grouped by
the fire-side and are chanting the following lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Wai dang bunnai,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Inna dinna dulla ngai.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The men sit in a row at the back of the fire, with their thighs
asunder and their legs bent in the knees; their chins are resting
upon their chests whilst they beat the backs of their heads
with small bundles of brushwood, keeping time with their song
and with the performance of the warrior.</p>

<p>When, after a while, the music ceases, the warrior is seen
to be lying asleep beside his captive. The ancestors become
restless and begin to move sideways, first in a body to the left
and then to the right; then they move backwards and forwards.
This movement is peculiarly weird since the performers do it
by shuffling over the ground in the sitting posture, with their
arms held erect, but bent in the elbow.</p>

<p>Presently the music starts again, and the spirit known as
“<i>Ngardaddi</i>” is seen to be stealthily creeping towards the fire,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
his body lying flat upon the ground and his legs dragging behind.
He advances very slowly, turning his face towards the
ground, in search of the fire which escaped from heaven. He
wears a tall head-dress quite thirty-two inches long, which consists
of a tightly fitting hemispherical cap carrying a column
in its centre, at the top of which a bundle of split black-cockatoo
feathers is attached. The feathers are from the male
bird’s tail, and the brilliant red patches in them are representative
of fire. The whole structure is made of paper-bark and
human hair-string, the outer surface being decorated with ochre,
pipeclay, charcoal, and vegetable-down. Vide <a href="#plate32">Plate XXXII</a>.</p>

<p>All the time the men at the fire-side are beating time with
their hands and simultaneously turn their heads from side to
side, to all intents and purposes quite unconcerned about the
Ngardaddi who is gradually crawling near to them. This is
done to entice the thief nearer and lead him to believe that
he is unobserved. All of a sudden, however, when the spirit
is about to touch the fire and is in the act of snatching it from
the tribesmen, one of the group on either side of the fire throws
a handful of dry grass upon the smouldering heap. The flame
responds immediately and casts a bright light all around.</p>

<p>Alarm is raised by the tribesmen by clapping their hands
together violently. The spirit collapses and lies flat upon the
ground at full length. Two or three of the men nearest by
seize some of the burning grass and hit the prostrate figure
over the head. The spirit jumps to his feet and treads the
ground as if endeavouring to make his escape. Seeing this,
the men at the fire rise quickly and treat their victim most unmercifully
with bundles of burning grass and twigs. Eventually
each of them seizes a fire-brand and digs the burning end
deeply into the spirit’s back and the unfortunate fellow eventually
decamps into the darkness amidst the bellowing whoops of
his victors.</p>

<p>The air is fouled for some distance around by the smell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
of the burned skin, reminding one of the stench in a smithy
when horses are being shod. The back of the spirit-impersonator
is naturally severely scored by the cruel treatment it is
subjected to, but the fellow takes it all in good faith and without
flinching.</p>

<p>The object of the ceremony is twofold. Firstly all members
of the community who are present, men, women, and children,
are taught to appreciate the value of fire, and secondly it is believed
that the exemplification of so harsh and drastic a treatment
for attempted theft will tend to make abortive any
schemes of the evil spirits.</p>

<p>The Arunndta are quite convinced in their own minds that
in the days of their tribal fathers there was no water on the
surface of the ground they occupied; their ancestors in those
times were compelled to live on grass and succulent plants, no
consideration being given to the fact, as we have learned, that
the vegetation derives its moisture from outside sources. But it
happened one day, when their forefathers were out hunting,
that they met with a number of strange-looking men who were
sitting around a pool of pure water from which they were
drinking. At the sight of the men, the strangers fled, leaving
the water behind. The hunters gave chase but all except one
disappeared and he made for a cave in the hills. The hunters
closed the mouth of the cave with a big stone and went back
to the pool of water to quench their thirst, but when they
reached the spot, the water had turned into a massive, round
stone. The men made back to the cave and removed the obstruction,
but imagine their surprise when they found the cave
empty. Upon making a careful search, however, they discovered
a long cylindrical stick which had some peculiar markings
on it. They took the stick and walked once more towards
the petrified pool, and, lo, they beheld the stranger they were
looking for walking in the sky. When he saw the stick in
the hands of the hunters, he took the form of a cloud, and as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
he bent his body towards the stick, his long matted hair fell
forwards and from it water poured upon the earth beneath.
The hunters drank freely of the precious fluid and when they
looked skywards again the cloudman had vanished.</p>

<p>From that day onwards the Arunndta medicine men
(“<i>Nangarri</i>”) have kept that spot sacred and taboo to the
women and children; they call the big stone “<i>Imbodna</i>” which
means “the hailstone.” The man who fled to the cave and then
escaped from the hunters as a vapour they call “<i>Nangali</i>,” the
name for a cloud. The tribe has never since been without
water because Nangali left his magic wand in the hands of
their ancient sorcerers and whenever the country was suffering
from drought they could call upon him to appear in the sky
and bring forth rain.</p>

<p>Nangali is one of a group of celestial beings who have been
termed “<i>Atoakwatje</i>,” that is Water-Men; they are now looked
upon as Demigods who control all terrestrial supplies of water
from their abode in the clouds. The Atoakwatje are believed
to have certain mysterious connections with some of the tribal
sorcerers who in a sense parade on earth as their disciples and
attend to the rain-making ceremonies through which they are
able to commune with each other.</p>

<p>When the people are in need of water, the rain-makers assemble
around the Imbodna and one or two of them produce
the sacred stick, known to the Arunndta as “<i>kwatje-purra</i>,”
literally meaning “the reproductive organ of water,” and to the
Aluridja as “<i>kapi-wiyinna</i>.” Nowadays these sticks, which
strictly speaking are of phallic significance, are flat and more
like a tjuringa in shape, and have a number of peculiar markings
on them. For a time the stick is laid beside the great
water-stone, and the sorcerers kneel while they chant with a
barely audible voice. They rise to their feet and the most influential
individual who is decorated with stripes of yellow
vegetable-down and wears a dog-tail tassel on his belt, lifts the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
stick towards the sky and continues mumbling. The other
members kneel again and all present chat together. The man
who is standing poises the stick horizontally between his hands
and rocks it one way, then another; and this performance is
frequently repeated.</p>

<p>When at length the principal performer sits down, the
other men leave the spot and run in a single file towards the
camp, loudly crying “<i>kurreke ta ta</i>” in imitation of the call of
the spur-winged plover.</p>

<p>In the evening a general corroboree is indulged in; and all
grown-up persons, male and female, are allowed to join in.
Several refrains are forthcoming which are connected with ordinary
rain or water festivals. The principal rainmaker does
not attend but joins the camp again during the night. It appears
that in the interim he has visited the sacred cave, in company
of one or two of his brother-sorcerers, to hide the magic
stick and preserve it for future use. Any representative of
the Atoakwatje group inherits the power to fashion and use the
rain-stick, but it is imperative that he learns the art under the
direction of a senior and duly qualified nangarri.</p>

<p>A ceremony directly connected with sun-worship belongs
to the old Arunndta people and is known as “<i>Ilpalinja</i>.” When
the weather has been and continues to be unpleasantly cold, and
the mating season of birds and animals has on that account
been long delayed, the men construct a large colored design
upon the selected ceremonial ground. Radiating from a point
upon a cleared space, many lines are drawn with red and white
vegetable-down to represent the rays of the sun; and these
are intersected at different distances from the central point by
a number of concentric circles which represent the fathers of
the tribe. The centre of the design is occupied by a stick
which is supposed to incorporate some mystical and sacred
sun-creature known as “<i>Knaninja Arrerreka</i>.” The same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
Ilpalinja-design is occasionally carved as the crest of the Knaninja
upon a sun-tjuringa. Vide <a href="#figure06">Fig. 6</a>.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 6. Sacred sun-design of the “<i>Ilpalinja</i>” ceremony (× 1/20).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A most impressive function might occasionally be witnessed
on the north coast, which is associated with the setting sun;
it is known to at least two tribes, the one living on the upper
reaches of the Victoria River and the other on the western
shores of Carpentaria Gulf, including some of the islands. It
is usually performed in conjunction with demonstrations calling
upon a fabulous being which lives in the sky to fecundate certain
species of plants and animals necessary for their daily life.
The Carpentaria tribes, moreover, keep their sacred poles, akin
to the tjuringas of central Australia, not in caves but in special
huts which they construct upon chosen spots absolutely taboo
to the general public. These slabs of wood are up to five
feet long and are covered with peculiar carvings and markings;
they are of the two sexes. Ordinarily they are kept
“asleep” by laying them on the floor of the hut side by side,
and covering them with sand. When the hour of the ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
arrives, they are brought out by the “Sun-Men” and
stuck in the ground in the full light of the sinking sun. Just
as the orb is about to touch the horizon, the tenders of the
sacred implements kneel, with their faces turned towards the
sun and, lifting their hands, bend their bodies to the ground
much after the fashion of an Eastern salaam. We have before
us a true form of worship recognizing the supreme powers of
the sun, but aimed primarily at calling upon a demigod or
Deity in supplication for making a needed article of diet,
animal or vegetable, fruitful or prolific.</p>

<p>Mythologically the sun is regarded as a female having human
form and a fiery exterior, who walks daily across the firmament
and returns at night to rest at her sacred haunts on earth.
Some of the central tribes, like the Aluridja, split the sun’s
identity into an indefinite number of such women, a different
one of which makes the journey every day.</p>

<p>The moon on the other hand is thought to be a man who
originally inhabited the earth but was one day chased off it
by a gigantic dog the Aluridja call “<i>Tutrarre</i>.” The man
jumped into space and walked among the clouds until he
reached the earth again. His long walk had made him so
hungry and thin that he ravenously ate a great number of
opossums which he found in the trees at night. In consequence
he swelled out, and became fat and round. Then it
was his bad fortune to fall in with the dog again, and this
time his obesity prevented his escape. The dog tore him to
pieces and swallowed him, bone and all. But it so happened
that one of his arm-bones flew from the dog’s jaws and found
its way to the sky. There it floated from east to west as a
luminous sickle and gradually swelled until it was perfectly
round. The dog stood looking up at the bone and howled in
anger, but the moon-man reappeared in the sky and converted
the dog into stone.</p>

<p>The Kakatu natives believe in a moon-man who lives in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
sky and controls the clouds. On a certain day, very long ago,
this man was seen by the ancestors of the tribe. It happened
thus: Just about dusk, a cloud was observed descending from
the sky which came to rest upon the summit of a hill; it was
glowing red. A big man, a woman, and two girls stepped
upon the earth, and the man took a fire-stick from the cloud
which then became black and ascended again. It was the moon-man
and his family. The party walked down on to the plain
and camped, the old man making a fire with his torch whereby
his feminine escort could warm themselves. The moon-man
left, taking a new fire-stick with him. In a deep, green
water-hole lived a monstrous snake whose colour was much like
that of the slime which covered the surface of the water. A
lengthy and secret interview took place between the moon-man
and the snake on the bank of the lagoon, and the snake produced
many tubers of water-lily, and mussels also, for the
moon-man to eat. Then the two heard a rustling noise. The
snake exclaimed: “What is that? Who dares approach our
trysting place?” The moon-man snatched a fire-brand and held
it high in the air; this made it light as day. The moon-man’s
daughters could be seen creeping towards the men to hear the
secret discussion! With a curse upon his mouth, the angry
father hurled the fire-stick at his deceitful daughters. The
stick struck the ground and sent a shower of sparks over the
girls. In an instant everything became dark as night, but
every now and again there came from the spot the girls had
last been seen at long-drawn growls; from the same spot flashes
of light shot forth and illumined the clouds. The snake and
the moon-man had disappeared, but the daughters remained
just where they had last been seen, for they had been turned
to stone and had assumed the rigid form of a dog whose head
was directed skywards as if to rebuke the moon-man for the
curse he had brought upon them. For a long time the clouds
remained dark; then the moon-man re-appeared among them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
and cast a mournful beam upon the canine image of his
daughters. From then till now he has continued to appear
periodically in the sky, and his repentant daughters gaze at him;
but at times, when the sky is covered with heavy black clouds,
the daughters become angry and growl aloud. At these times,
too, bright flashes dart from their eyes across the clouds like
spears of fire threatening revenge. The stone has remained
to the present day, and is known by the name of “<i>Koreno
kardjo</i> (dog) <i>gambi</i>” (stone).</p>

<p>The snake is an important character in the mythology of
practically every tribe of Australia; in fact most of the permanent
water-holes are supposed to be inhabited by great serpents
which guard the supplies, destroy unlawful consumers
or polluters thereof, and frequently communicate with those
spirit ancestors of the tribes who are descended from the
original snake-man still living in the sky. In many cases the
mythic snakes can be recognized in some characteristic features
of the landscape. Take, for instance, the great artesian
spring near Coward Springs Station which is known as Blanche
Cup. This is looked upon as the mouth of a snake, while the
hill immediately at the back of it (Mt. Hamilton) is its head.
In consequence the formation is called “<i>Worma-Kadiabba</i>”
(snake’s head) by the local Arrabonna tribe. The natives have
a dread of these imaginary snake-monsters and prefer not to
visit a water-hole at night; in fact, at any time, day or night,
they feel safer in the company of a man who is “related” to the
snake, because he can protect them and give them the right of
approach. The snake is possessed of evil and will molest any
but its totemic “relatives.”</p>

<p>The fundamental conception of the kobong (or totem), so
far as the Australian aboriginal is concerned, is of a religious
nature. In the beginning of all things, the Aluridja say a
number of exalted creatures of human form came out of the
earth and were gracious to their tribes-people. Then appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
a menace in the shape of a gigantic dog which chased the
good people from one place to another, until they decided to
adopt the forms of various animals and plants, and thereby became
either too fleet for the dog or were not recognized by it.
Other good people now descended from the hills and drove the
dog back to its hiding place in a cave where the evil spirit
dwells. The newcomers kindled a fire at the mouth of the
cave and kept the evil beings in captivity whilst the original
Deities re-assumed the human form. Ever after, however, these
good creatures were able to alter their appearance from human
to animal at will; but each individual in his choice adhered
to the particular animal or plant which had saved him from
the ravages of the great evil dog. Eventually they formed
themselves into flat slabs of stone or wood, upon the surfaces
of which they scratched the emblems of their animal representation
and the traditions of their long wanderings on earth.
The spirits of these Deities now live in the sky but can return
at any time to re-enter the slab generally known as the
“tjuringa.” Among the Minning at Eucla the larger of these
objects are known as “<i>wagal-wagal</i>,” the smaller as “<i>bobi</i>,”
whilst further west, in the Laverton district, “<i>kaidi</i>” is the prevailing
word. It is true, the tjuringa is not known to all
tribes; in which case the Deities are supposed to have entered
such natural objects as rocks, hills, and conspicuous trees.</p>

<p>The Roper River natives believe that their deified forbears
were molested not by a dog, but by a hideous old woman or
witch, who, by the influence of evil, entrapped them and subsequently
ate them. On one occasion, however, a party of
warriors were successful in decoying her away from her haunts
and slaying her. The jubilant victors decided to cut out the
old woman’s tongue as a trophy, but as they were thus engaged,
the tongue flew out of the mouth and spun round in the
atmosphere above them, making a terrible noise as it did so.
The men chased the tongue, but it flew towards a beefwood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
tree and embedded itself deeply in the butt; in vain they
looked for it and tried to cut it out; it had become part of the
tree. Before returning, however, the men took a piece of wood
out of the tree, shaped like the woman’s tongue, which they
tied to a piece of human hair-string and swung round their
heads with joy. Behold their mixed feelings of delight and
fear when the piece of wood began to howl with a voice like
that of the slain witch! The tribe retained that piece of wood
as a sacred memento of their victory, and they gave to it the
name the witch was known by, namely “<i>Kunapippi</i>.” Nowadays
this object is the equivalent of the central Australian
<i>tjuringa</i>.</p>

<p>All tribes recognize the existence of deified ancestors, now
real or spiritual, whom they regard as sacred and worship
accordingly. All ancestors stand in a definite, intricate, and
intimate relationship to some animal, plant, water-hole, or
other natural object which they have at some time or other
represented; some indeed in the first place appeared as animals
and later took the human form. They are now looked upon
as being those powers who by virtue of sacred ceremonial can
produce the species they have at some time incarnated, in
plenty or allow it to proliferate. As a matter of fact, some of
the sorcerers of the tribes often declare that they can see the
inside of a sacred rock or tjuringa teeming with young, ready
to be produced.</p>

<p>The Arunndta refer to their “<i>Knaninja</i>” (i.e. “totem”
Deities) as “<i>Altjerrajara</i>,” meaning the Supreme Number; the
Aluridja as “<i>Tukurata</i>” or “<i>Tukutita</i>”; and the Dieri as
“<i>Muramura</i>.”</p>

<p>Just as the “totem” ancestor is connected with an animal,
plant, or other natural object, and is embodied in the sacred
form of the tjuringa, so the individual who traces his descent
from such ancestor recognizes a close and mysterious affinity
between himself and the tjuringa which has become his by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
heredity; henceforth it becomes his sacred talisman which protects
him from evil and procures for him the means of maintaining
his existence.</p>

<p>The emblematic representation of the deified ancestor, based
upon the form of an animal or plant living to-day and in some
way “connected” with the individual, is the “<i>kobong</i>” of the
north-western tribes first referred to by Sir George Grey.</p>

<p>The “totem” is very dear and sacred to the native, and is
religiously protected by him. I well remember on one occasion
on the Alberga River I discovered a small black and yellow
banded snake which I killed. An Aluridja man who was
attached to the party at the time was greatly shocked at this,
and, with genuine sorrow, told me that I had killed his
“brother.” Turning to an Arunndta he lamented aloud:
“<i>Kornye! Nanni kallye nuka kalla illum</i>,” which literally
translated means: “Oh dear! This brother of mine is dead.”</p>

<p>One thing is always essential and that is that a native performs
frequent, prolonged, and reverential ceremonies, remote
from the women and children, and in the presence of his
tjuringa. Under these conditions the tjuringa is believed to
have powers similar to those of the Deity it embodies.</p>

<p>When not in use, the tjuringas are stored in caves, the
entrances to which are small and not easily discernible; the
ground is proclaimed taboo to any but initiated tjuringa holders
and is strictly regarded as a <i>sanctum sanctorum</i>. Although
the sticks and stones are the individual property of the tribesmen,
the objects are generally kept together, and only brought
out during a religious ceremony. The old men are the
authorized custodians of the sacred collection. The female
tjuringas are included, because even though a woman may
possess one, she must never see it; if she does, accidentally or
otherwise, she is in imminent danger of being killed. No
unauthorized hunter is allowed near the prohibited area under
any pretext at all; even if an animal he has wounded should by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
accident make for the sacred ground to breathe its last, the
hunter is required by tribal law and usage to sacrifice it to the
divine factors incorporated in the tjuringa, by leaving it on
the spot.</p>

</figure>

<p>When on the warpath, a warrior always craves to carry his
tjuringa with him, even though this is not always possible. He
firmly believes that with the talisman kept on his person, or at
any rate knowing that it is nearby, no deadly missile thrown by
an enemy will penetrate his body. The mere knowledge of the
fact that his opponent has a tjuringa with him, and he not, is
sufficient to make a coward of the bravest fighter. Should he
be wounded or take ill, one of his “totem-brothers” endeavours
to produce a tjuringa, from which, if the medicine man considers
it necessary, a little powder is scraped and handed to the
patient to swallow with water.</p>

<p>With regard to “totem” animals which form the objects of
hunting expeditions, a man is allowed to kill and eat thereof
with some restriction. He must kill only one animal at a
time, and only in accordance with the method prescribed by the
tribal fathers and handed down to them by tradition. This is
usually a straightforward hunting method, with as little loss
of blood as possible. If much blood should flow, the hunter is
obliged to cover it without delay with sand. If possible, other
men should cut up the carcase, and only certain portions be
handed to the “brother” of the slain animal.</p>

<p>Each tribe has an endless variety of objects (animal, vegetable,
terrestrial, meteoric, mythic, and so forth), which may
figure as a “totem.” Any one of these may be the primary
motive of a separate cult or sacred ceremony, but here again
the variety is usually reduced to the number corresponding to
the most sanctimonious and most useful creations affecting the
affairs of the particular tribe.</p>

<p>The ceremonies take the form of either a direct worship or
a prayer for increased productivity of a certain plant or animal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
either being offered to the Knaninja or “totem” ancestors living
as spirits in the sky. Usually the two ideas are embodied in
one grand ceremony, and the method of procedure is governed
by tradition. Such ceremonies have been particularly elaborated
by the Arunndta tribe, who refer to them by the same name as
that of the sacred object, namely “<i>Tjuringa</i>”; less frequently
they call them “<i>Intitjuma</i>,” the latter name being applied more
to ceremonies without worship.</p>

<p>The Tjuringa ceremonies are divided into grades according
to their importance and sacredness. The water ceremony is
ordinarily called “<i>Kwatje Tjuringa</i>,” but if the “totem” spirit
ancestor is invoked to attend, it goes by the name of “<i>Kwatje
Tjuringa Knaninja</i>”; if the principal spirit ancestor is assumed
to be present, the title becomes “<i>Kwatje Tjuringa Knaninja
Knurrendora</i>”; and finally the most sacred water ceremony of
all is the “<i>Kwatje Tjuringa Altjerra Knaninja Knurrendora</i>.”</p>

<p>As a typical illustration we shall discuss the “<i>Illiya Tjuringa</i>”
or Great Emu Ceremony of the eastern Arunndta
groups. The date of the performance is decided by the senior
emu “brother” of the tribe, the oldest member who claims to
be related to the Illiya Knaninja. Somewhat extensive preparations
are made beginning a few days prior to the opening
event. Only fully initiated men take part, but the women are
allowed to witness certain of the most awe-inspiring stages from
a distance. Whilst the younger men are out collecting leaves,
out of which they make the down later to adorn the bodies of
the performers, the older men prepare the sacred ground.
Others slay a number of brown hawks, off which they pull the
feathers and then pluck the down. A suitable site having been
selected, the old men clear it by removing all grass and bush
from the surface and smoothing the sand with their feet. The
“brothers” who claim relationship alike to the great Emu-Man,
the Emu-Knaninja, and the emu itself, thereupon proceed to
anoint the sacred ground with their blood, for which purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
they puncture the median basilic vein of the forearm with a
quartzite chip and allow the fluid of kinship to sprinkle upon
the sand. It is surprising to see the amount of blood sacrificed
by the men on occasions like this; and time after time, when
such is required, the process is repeated. By examining the
forearms of an old stager, one can usually count a number of
small scars along the course of a vein indicating places where
a perforation has at different times been made. A venesection
is made after much the same manner among the various tribes.</p>

<p>The following Arunndta method will serve as an example.
A ligature of hair-string is in the first place tied tightly round
the upper arm, a little above the biceps muscle, after the style
of a tourniquet to check the flow of blood in the veins and
thereby distend the vessels. The man then makes a small
longitudinal cut through the skin and punctures the vein beneath
it lengthwise; the blood spurts forth immediately and is
collected in the handle-pit of a shield. When the flow is to be
stopped, the native removes the ligature, and this in most cases
is all that is needed. Should, however, the blood continue to
come, he places a small amount of down over the incision and
presses it against the vein, or winds three or four strands of
fur-string around it. The little pad of down is usually left on
the arm until it dries and falls off. None of the women are
allowed to witness this operation, which is called “<i>Ilgarukna</i>.”
The blood, when it is to be used as an adhesive for the down-decoration,
is applied with a small brush (“<i>ipinja</i>”) made of
twigs tied together with fur-string. Vide <a href="#plate33">Plate XXXIII</a>.</p>

<p>The principal among the emu group is called “<i>Illiyakuta</i>,”
and it is he who directs the performance. He takes his followers
to a secluded place, such as a clump of timber or down
a creek-bed, and there the wooden tjuringas belonging to the
ceremony are produced and painted afresh with red ochre and
emu fat.</p>

<p>Down is made out of the white, felty leaves and twigs of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
<i>Kochia</i> bush, which the Arunndta call “<i>kemba</i>.” Small quantities
of these are placed upon a flat slab of stone and pounded
with a pebble. The fluffy material which results is next mixed
and rubbed by hand with powdered kaolin or ochre according
to the colour required, the white being known as “<i>wadua</i>,” the
red as “<i>wanjerra</i>.”</p>

<p>A sacred object is now constructed which encloses the painted
tjuringas and is called the “<i>Tjilbakuta</i>.” It is about three feet
high and is made in the following way. The tjuringas are
laid one on top of the other and bound together with many
lengths of human hair-string, which completely obscure the
shape of the separate pieces. A thick layer of the stalks of the
kangaroo grass (<i>Anthistiria</i>) is laid around the parcel and kept
in position with a few lengths of twine, and then the whole
structure is covered with great masses of human hair-string
wound spirally from top to bottom. A cylinder results which
is decorated with alternate vertical bands of red and white
vegetable down. Into the top of this Tjilbakuta one bundle
of emu feathers and one of black cockatoo tail-feathers are
stuck; and often additional plumes are hung beneath them.
The moment the sacred object is completed, the Illiyakuta
delegates one of his group to act as its attendant or guardian.
For the time being his body is decorated with symmetrically
placed, curved ochre bands upon the chest and vertical bands
down the arms; at a later stage he ornaments his body more
elaborately, prior to taking part in the principal performance;
but all the time he remains in his place of hiding beside the
Tjilbakuta. Vide <a href="#plate34">Plate XXXIV</a>.</p>

<p>At the sanctified place close by the other men have been
stacking firewood at different points to illuminate the proceedings
during the evening. Occasionally, too, the Illiyakuta
group of men cover a portion of the ground with a coloured
emblem of the traditional emu.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon of the festive day the men who will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
take part in the ceremony at night begin to prepare themselves.
Many of the non-performers help them.</p>

<p>Large quantities of down, both vegetable and birds’, are used
to decorate the bodies. The design is shaped much like a
cobbler’s apron, extending from the neck down the front to
the level of the knees. The greater part of this surface is red,
but it is lined with white and split along the centre by two
parallel lines of white. The back is not decorated at all. The
entire surface of the face, including the eye-lids and beard, is
thickly covered with down which is white, except for an oval
red patch around the mouth.</p>

<p>The principal attraction, however, of the sacred emu ceremony
is the head-dress, which is both elaborate and imposing.
To prepare it, the attendant combs back the actor’s hair with
his fingers, and interlaces it with stalks of grass and small twigs
in such a way that a tall conical structure results right on top
of the head. This is made secure and of a uniform exterior
by winding much human hair-string around it, at the same time
taking in a plume of emu feathers at the apex of the cone.
The headgear is completely enveloped in red and white down,
extending upwards from the head as alternate vertical bands.
The chief emu-man is distinguished by an extra large headdress
called the “<i>Illiya Altjerra Kuta</i>”; this measures a good
three feet in length, and it embodies, between the apex and the
emu plume, deeply enshrouded with hair-string and down, the
sacred “<i>Illiya Tjuringa</i>.” Other members who are of the same
rank as the “Tjilbakuta” guardian, wear their insignia beneath
the emu feathers in the form of a sickle-shaped rod, which
carries at each of its points a tuft of white cockatoo feathers.
All performers cover their person with a dog-tail appendage
which hangs from a thin waistband of human hair-string. And
lastly, they all tie bundles of eucalyptus twigs, with the leaves
attached, to their legs just above the ankles. If possible, old
or half-dried leaves are selected in order that a more pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
rustling is produced when the men move about; the noise is
made to imitate the rustle of the wiry feathers of an emu. Vide
<a href="#plate35">Plate XXXV</a>.</p>

<p>At nightfall the Tjilbakuta is removed from the hiding place
and planted on the edge of the ensanguined patch. The
guardian is thus given an opportunity to slip away and to
attend to his ceremonial toilet, which is similar to that of the
rest of the Tjilbakuta group. When he returns, the performance
is about to begin, and all except he leave the ground.</p>

<p>The stacks of wood are set fire to by invisible hands, and,
so soon as the flames flare upwards, the silence is broken by
the booming note of a bull-roarer, which is produced some
distance off in the bush.</p>

<p>The Tjilbakuta guardian sits beside the object like a statue,
with his eyes rivetted to the ground immediately in front of
him. From behind him the thud of stamping feet and the
rustle of dry leaves announce the coming of the official performers,
while from the other side the non-performing members
step from the darkness and take up their position by
squatting between two fires. When the decorated men come
into view, the latter start beating their boomerangs together
in perfect time to the stamping of the feet of the advancing
actors. They come as a body of five or six rows, one behind
the other, each man holding his hands locked behind his back
and uttering a deep guttural note resembling a pig’s grunt. The
folded hands held over the stern represent the tail, the guttural
noise the call of the emu.</p>

<p>The Illiyakuta, wearing the tall Illiya Altjerra Kuta, is in
the front row, and he is attended on either side by a Tjilbakuta
man. The chief now starts a chant: “<i>Immara janki darrai</i>,”
and all the others, including the sitting men, join in; the same
is repeated several times. When the two parties are opposite
each other, the performers quicken the pace of their stamping
and extend their arms sideways, thereby widening their ranks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
After this they retreat to behind the Tjilbakuta and one hears
a shrill chirping note resembling the cry of a young emu.</p>

<p>The interpretation of this act needs no special elucidation.
The decorated performers are those of the tribe’s manhood
who, in all matters pertaining to the emu, have a right to
communicate, through the Tjilbakuta, with the astral emu ancestor
living in the great celestial domain of the ancestral
spirits, which is known as “<i>Altjerringa</i>.” They are invoking
the benign Knaninja or originator of their particular “totem”
species to increase the numbers of emu on earth for the exclusive
benefit of their tribe. It is the Illiyakuta who imagines
that he receives the favourable response from above, and, when
it comes, it is he who imitates the cry of a young emu. It
often happens, however, that the chief persuades himself to believe
that the Great Spirit had not heeded the appeal, in which
case the last-mentioned cry is wanting. The ceremony is repeated
time after time.</p>

<p>Altjerringa, it will be observed, is a compound word consisting
of “<i>Altjerra</i>,” the Supreme Spirit, and “<i>inga</i>,” a foot or
trail. The implied idea is that Altjerringa is the “walk-about”
of the spirit ancestors, where they walk, and have always
walked, and where the spirits of all tribes-people eventually
hope to find their way.</p>

<p>After this act, the performance becomes less restrained and
takes more the form of a corrobboree. Some of the men seize
firebrands from the burning stacks and hurl them in the direction
of the women’s camp. From the moment of the sounding
of the bull-roarer at the beginning of the ceremony until now
the women sat huddled together, with their faces buried in
their hands, thoroughly cowed by the portentous happenings.
When the firebrands come whizzing through the air and crash
into the branches of the trees around them, sending sparks
flying in all directions, they are almost beyond themselves with
fear. But just at this juncture the men call upon them to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
look towards the festive ground and behold them dancing. In
obedience to the order, the women’s fears are dispelled and
soon superseded by a noticeable enravishment. They feast their
eyes upon the array of manhood in gala dress, and it is not
long ere they pick up the rhythm of a dance by beating time
to the step. Provided the Tjilbakuta has been removed to a
place of secrecy, well out of reach of accidental discovery, the
men entreat the women to come up and join in the song.
Thus the sublime is eventually reduced to commonplace, and
the remainder of the night passes in joviality.</p>

<p>To refer briefly to a vegetable ceremony, we shall select the
yam or “<i>Ladjia Tjuringa Knaninja</i>.” The preparations are
much the same as those of the emu ceremony. An enclosure
is first made in a secluded spot with branches, in the centre of
which the “totem” or Knaninja “stick” is erected. Several
men immediately set about to decorate it with vegetable down
as previously described. The design in this case consists of
vertical rows of red circles upon a yellow ochre background.
In addition, a large plume of split eagle-hawk feathers is stuck
into the top of the stick. All ordinary performers wear conical
head-gears or “<i>tdela</i>” made of <i>Cassia</i> twigs, into the apices of
which tightly bound bundles of grass stalks (“<i>gortara</i>”) are
fixed carrying plumes of emu feathers (“<i>mangalingala</i>”)
(<a href="#plate26">Plate XXXVI</a>, 1). Other men have squat, cylindrical bark
structures called “<i>elbola</i>” placed over their heads, which are
elaborately decorated with vertical coils of human hair-string
and coloured down.</p>

<p>One of the principal actors represents the “<i>Kuta Knaninja</i>.”
His head-gear consists of two long kutturu, tied together with
hair-string and completely covered with gum leaves, the whole
being subsequently besmeared with blood and decorated with
coloured down. As the assistants are dressing this character,
they keep up a chant sounding like “<i>Winni kutcherai</i>.” Vide
<a href="#plate36">Plate XXXVI</a>, 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>The leading figure is the “<i>Ingada Ladjia Knaninja</i>,” who
wears a tall vertical head-piece which contains the tjuringa of
the Ladjia Knaninja. The tjuringa is, however, not visible,
but is covered with pieces of bark, securely tied over it with
hair-string, the whole being richly decorated with vertical bands
of red and white down.</p>

<p>The Great Spirit of the Yam, called “<i>Knaninja Tjilba
Ladjia</i>,” when he leaves Altjerringa, takes up his abode in a
cave near Mount Conway, where the tjuringas are kept, but
at night, before the fires are lit, he is supposed to come to the
ceremonial ground and occupy the decorated “totem” stick
described above. During the performance he is surrounded by
all the ordinary performers, who are known as “<i>Tjilba Ingarrega</i>,”
and are directly under the guidance of the Ingada and
Kuta Knaninja.</p>

<p>A group of men who are not decorated sit near one of the
fires and sing while the performers are thus encircling the
Ladjia stick:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Imbanai yinga</i></div>

    <div class="verse indent0"><i>De a re a ja betja</i>,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the voices finally fading away to an almost inaudible whisper.</p>

<p>If the Great Spirit, Ladjia Altjerra Knaninja, is gracious,
the tap-root of the yam will be sent deep down into the earth
near the Jay River and from there spread its laterals all over
the country to supply the needs of the tribe.</p>

<p>When some of the most sacred ceremonies are performed,
the oldest “relatives” of the presiding Knaninja often construct
a coloured drawing upon the consecrated ground, whose purpose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
is similar to that of the “totem” stick above described.
The drawing is executed in coloured down, both vegetable and
bird. A space of suitable size, often measuring many feet in
length, is cleared of grass and stones, and sprinkled with water,
when it is ready to receive the down. In the case of, say, the
“<i>Ladjia Tjuringa</i>,” the design takes the form of a number of
concentric circles alternately red and white, from the outermost
of which six equally spaced groups of red and white lines
stand out radially. The enclosing border of the design consists
entirely of white down. Vide <a href="#plate37">Plate XXXVII</a>.</p>

<p>Once constructed, this drawing, which is known as “<i>Etominja</i>,”
is zealously guarded by one of the old men. If, peradventure,
an unauthorized person happens upon the sanctified
place, he is killed and buried immediately beneath the spot
occupied by the design; thereupon the ground is smoothed again
and the Etominja re-constructed. Nobody in camp ever hears
what became of the person, and should any relative track him
in the direction of the area known to be tabooed, he is horror-stricken
and runs away.</p>

<p>While the old men are re-constructing the Etominja, they
sing to the Knaninja as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Yedimidimi</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Dakarai pa ma taka,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Pa mitu min jai, jin tarai,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Ja ra nai malgada, ja ranai.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The next, and probably the most important, group of religious
ceremonies is that dealing with Sex-Worship. For
years past peculiarly shaped stones have been found in caves
and among the possessions of the Australian aborigines whose
shape was strikingly suggestive of a phallus, but hitherto no
actual phallic ceremonies have been observed. It was my good
fortune to witness such among the Aluridja, Arunndta, Dieri,
and Cambridge Gulf tribes. From enquiries made of the old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
men, it appears that in former days this form of worship was
practised considerably more than it is nowadays. New stone
phallus are rarely made by the present tribes; those in their
possession have generally been inherited from previous generations.
The old men have the phallus in their keeping, and
they are very loth to either produce or part with them.</p>

<p>The natives of the King Sound district in the north-west believe
the origin of the phallus to be as follows: In the early times
a scourge was raging among their forefathers, from the effects of
which many were daily dying, when a hairy man and his mate,
a woman of ordinary human form, came to earth from above.
The evil was due to the exhalation of poisonous breath from
the gaping jaws of a green monster resembling a crocodile.
The stranger relieved the sufferers from the awful curse by
showing them how to perform an operation upon their person
which taught them to endure pain and protected them against
future ravages of the pestilence. This great and benevolent
stranger then took his departure, but left his name to designate
the surgical operation which to the present day is performed
upon the male members of the tribe; the name, strange though
it may seem, is “<i>Elaija</i>”; and it is known, at any rate, as far
east as Port George IV. But the tribe had become so weak
through the terrible havoc the disease had wrought that the
old men called him back and entreated him to stay. Elaija,
however, took from a dillybag his female companion was carrying,
a stone carved after the shape of a mutilated member,
which he gave the name of “<i>Kadabba</i>.” When the old men
gazed upon this object, they took fright and appealed to Elaija,
but the good fellow had vanished. The stone has remained
with the tribe ever since, and through the divine property
Elaija endowed it with, their threatened extinction was eluded.
Moreover, they continued to practise the operation on all young
men because it made their members like the Kadabba of Elaija,
which they knew had the power of multiplying their kind.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
And so the Kadabba became a sacred object whose procreative
power they have learned to worship, thinking that by such
observance they would augment their own capacities of sex.
Vide <a href="#figure07">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="figure07" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure07.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 7. Stone phallus, Northern Kimberleys, Western Australia (× 1/2).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One often reads, and I was under the same impression myself
until I became better acquainted with the tribes, that the Australian
natives do not connect the knowledge of conception with
any intercourse which might have taken place between the sexes.
This I find is not altogether correct, although usually the
younger people are kept in complete ignorance on the subject.
No doubt strangers are treated similarly when they put any
pertinent questions to the old men on matters of sex. The old
men believe in the duality of human creation, the spiritual and
the material; sexuality is regarded as the stimulus of corporeal
reproduction, but the spirit quantity is derived through mystic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and abstract influences controlled by a “totem”-spirit or
Knaninja. Under these circumstances, it is not surprising to
note that the ceremonies of the phallus are transacted principally
by the old men of the tribe who aim at the rejuvenation
of their waning powers.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see the old men preparing for a ceremony
which is to be dedicated to a Knaninja or Spirit of Sex, because
they all endeavour to conceal the white hairs of their
beards by rubbing powdered charcoal into them. The bark of
the cork tree (<i>Hakea</i>) is used for the purpose; pieces of it are
charred, crushed between the palms, and applied where needed.
It is astounding what a difference this process makes to the
appearance, and some of the old grey-beards really look as
though they had been made twenty years younger by magic.</p>

<p>In the eastern MacDonnell Ranges stands a cylindro-conical
monolith whose origin is believed to be as follows: Many generations
ago, the paternal ancestors of the Arunndta walked
from a district situated, as near as one can gather, somewhere
in the neighbourhood of Ediowie; they were known as the
“<i>Kukadja</i>,” and were characterized by the enormous dimensions
of their organs. These old men or Tjilba of the tribe
migrated northwards to beyond Tennant’s Creek and settled in
the productive “<i>Allaia</i>” country which surrounds the Victoria
River. In that same district one finds, even at the present day,
cave drawings of human beings with the anatomical peculiarities
referred to (<a href="#figure08">Fig. 8</a>). At a later time, the head-man of the
Kukadja, named “<i>Knurriga Tjilba</i>,” returned southwards to the
Macdonnell Ranges. While roaming the hills, he espied two
young women sitting on the side of a quartzite cliff, and without
deliberation began to approach them. He was in the act of
making lewd overtures when the guardian of the girls, a crow
ancestor, caught sight of him and hurled a boomerang at him.
The missile struck the great man and cut off the prominent
portion of his body, which in falling stuck erect in the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
The force of the impact was so great that the man bounced
off the earth and fell somewhere near Barrow’s Creek. He
bled so profusely that a clay-pan soon filled with his blood.
Thus his followers found him, and overcome with sorrow they
opened the veins of their arms to mix their blood with his.
Then all the members of the party jumped into the pool and
disappeared for ever.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 8. Ochre drawing of “<i>Kukadja</i>” men, north of Wickham River,

</figure>

<p>The severed portion of the old man’s body, however, remained
just where it fell and turned to stone. It has long
been known as “<i>Knurriga Tjilba Purra</i>.”</p>

<p>The two young women can also still be detected in the cliff
as prominent rock formations.</p>

<p>The stone has been protected by the tribe as long as the
old men can remember, because they realize that it contains an
inexhaustible number of unborn tribes-people. These mythic,
foetal elements are generally recognized to exist in certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
objects of phallic significance, and are called “<i>rattappa</i>.” The
medicine men maintain that they can at times see the dormant
living matter in the stone. It is on that account that it is
regarded as sacred, and every now and then very secret and
worshipful ceremonies are transacted near its base, the main
objects of which are to multiply the future membership of the
tribe and to preserve the sexual powers of the old men.</p>

<p>The Tjilba Purra naturally figures prominently in some of
their ceremonies. In fact, it is reproduced and worn upon the
head of the leading man during the functions. The sacred
effigy consists of an upright column, about two feet high, composed
of a stout bundle of grass stalks, in the centre of which
the tjuringa is contained. It is decorated with alternating
bands of red and white down throughout its length. This
upright column represents the “<i>Tjilba</i>” or revered ancestor
whose spirit is invoked to “sit” in the tjuringa; at the top of
it a plume of wiry emu feathers, well powdered with charcoal
(“<i>unjia</i>”) to give it a youthful appearance, takes the place of
the forbear’s hair and beard. Standing at an angle with the
central column, a similar though slightly smaller structure is
intended for the “<i>Purra</i>” or phallus; it carries a plume of
white cockatoo feathers at its end to represent the glans. Vide
<a href="#plate38">Plate XXXVIII</a>, 2.</p>

<p>A landmark, of similar significance as the Tjilba Purra of the
Arunndta, exists on the Roper River in the Northern Territory;
it is a pillar of sandstone known as “<i>Waraka</i>.” Waraka
is also the name of the great Spirit Father of the tribe. In
very early times this man came to earth in a semi-human form,
and made the country abound in game, animals, birds, and
fish. Then he found a woman on the shores of Carpentaria
Gulf who remained with him as his wife. Many children
came of the union; and Waraka’s mate has since been looked
upon as the mother of the tribe. The woman’s name was
“<i>Imboromba</i>,” and to this day the tribe takes its name after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
her. Warraka had an enormous sex characteristic which was
so ponderous that he was obliged to carry it over one of his
shoulders. Eventually the organ became so huge that Warraka
collapsed and sank into the earth. His burden remained, but
turned to stone, and is now looked upon by the local natives
as the great symbol of Nature’s generative power which first
produced their game supplies and then the original children of
the tribe; it is revered accordingly.</p>

<p>The Kukata have a somewhat similar legend of the origin
of a stone of phallic significance, the name of the possessor of
the large organ being “<i>Kalunuinti</i>.”</p>

<p>In the extreme north-western corner of Australia, in the
Glenelg River district, the natural stone is replaced by an
artificially constructed one which possesses the true shape of a
phallus. The stone is about three feet long and stands in a
vertical position in the ground commanding a ceremonial cirque
as if intended to watch over the proceedings which are instituted
there.</p>

<p>On the shores of Cambridge Gulf, a grotesque dance is performed
by the men, during which a flat, wooden phallus is
used, shaped almost like a tjuringa, about seventeen inches long
and three inches wide at the middle. It is painted in alternate
bands of red and black, running transversely across the two flat
surfaces, which are, in addition, decorated with the carved representations
of the male organ of generation. The dance
takes place at night and is too intricate to describe in detail.
It is introduced by the following chant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Wa, la, ja-la-la</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Wa, la, ja-la-la</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Wa la gori wau!</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The verse is repeated three times, and then the performers
stamp the ground with their feet, about ten times in quick
succession, the action suggesting running without making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
headway. Presently, and with one accord, the whole party
falls upon the knees. The phallus is seized with both hands
and held against the pubes in an erect position, and so the
party slides over the ground from left to right, and again from
right to left. An unmistakably suggestive act follows, when
the men jerk their shoulders and lean forward to a semi-prone
position, after the fashion generally adopted by the aborigines.
Still upon their knees, the men lay the phallus upon the ground
and shuffle sideways, hither and thither, but always facing the
object in front of them. After several repetitions of this
interact, the performers raise their hands, in which they are
now carrying small tufts of grass or twigs, and flourish them
above their heads, while their bodies remain prone. Then
follow some very lithe, but at the same time very significant,
movements of the hips. When, presently, they rise to their
feet again, the phallus are once more reclaimed and held with
one of the pointed ends against the pubes in an erect position.
A wild dance concludes the ceremony, during which the men
become intensely agitated and emotional; very often, indeed,
their excitement, verging on hysterical sensibility, evokes an
orgasm.</p>

</figure>

<p>These occurrences must not be confused with the mixed
intercourses which occasionally take place at the climax of
friendly corrobborees to celebrate the meeting of neighbouring
tribes. In this case we merely have to do with an inter-sexual
embrace following an animated orgy, in which those members
of both tribes standing in the general relationship of husband
to wife take part.</p>

<p>The Dieri have a number of long cylindro-conical stones in
their possession which are supposed to temporarily contain the
male element of certain ancestral spirits now residing in the
sky as their recognized deities. These are on an average about
fifteen inches long and an inch and a half in diameter, circular
in transverse section and pointed at one end. The old men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
have these phallus in their custody, and are very unwilling
to let them get out of their reach because they believe the
virility of the tribe is dependent upon the preservation of the
stones. Should one of them be accidentally lost, the mishap is
calculated as little short of disastrous; should a stranger find
the object, the old men maintain that evil will come to him,
and if he keeps it he will die. The stone is used principally
during religious ceremonies connected with sex-worship, but it
is also produced during some of the initiation practices. After
he has submitted to the “gruesome rite” in his initiation, a
novice is required to carry the stone, firmly pressing it against
his body with his arm, until he is overcome by the exhaustion
occasioned by the painful ordeal. By so doing, the young
fellow’s virile powers are supposed to receive considerable
stimulation through the agency of the phallus he carries. The
object drops into the sand beside him; and, when he recovers,
he returns to the men’s camp without it. Two of the old men
thereupon track the lad’s outward course and recover their
sacred stone to take it back to a place of safety.</p>

<p>The tribes inhabiting the great stony plains of central Australia
and those adjoining them, and also the Victoria Desert
tribes, are occasionally in possession of nodular ironstone and
concretionary sandstone formations, of the “natural freak” kind,
which simulate the <i>membrum virile</i> to a marked degree. These
are believed to have been left them by a deified ancestor and
are kept by the old men as a sacred legacy; they answer in
every way the purpose of an artificially constructed phallus.</p>

<p>Closely allied to the phallic significance given to natural
pillars of rock and smaller imitative specimens, is the idea
that natural clefts in the earth represent a female character.
Killalpaninna is the name of a small lake lying about fifty miles
east of Lake Eyre in central Australia, it being the contracted
form of the two words, “<i>killa</i>” and “<i>wulpanna</i>,” which stand
for that typical of woman. It is the conviction of the Dieri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
tribe that when a person, especially one stricken with senility
or enfeebled by sickness, at a certain hour passes from the water
of the lake into the open, and is not seen doing so by the
women, he is re-born and rejuvenated, or at any rate cured of
his decrepitness. In this sense Killa-Wulpanna has from time
immemorial been an aboriginal Mecca, to which pilgrims have
found their way from far and wide to seek remedy and
solace at the great matronal chasm which has such divine
powers to impart. This fact is of particular interest, since a
native, generally speaking, is superstitious about entering any
strange water, and does so very reluctantly, thinking that, by
doing so, the evil spirit will foist disease upon him through the
medium of the water.</p>

<p>A singular stone exists in Ellery Creek, a short distance
south of the MacDonnell Ranges, which is called “<i>Arrolmolbma</i>.”
It was at this place that a tribal ancestor, named
“<i>Rukkutta</i>,” a long time ago met a young gin, “<i>Indorida</i>,” and
captured her. The stone at the present time shows a cleft
and two depressions which are supposed to be the knee-marks
of Rukkutta. On account of the intimacy which took place,
the stone is believed to be teeming with rattappa, which entered
by the cleft. The ancient Arunndta men used to make this
stone the object of special veneration, and during the sacred
ceremonies which took place at the spot, they used to produce
carved slabs of stone they called “<i>Altjerra Kutta</i>” (i.e. the
Supreme Spirit’s Stone or Tjuringa). These inspirited slabs
of stone, being of the two sexes, were allowed to repeat the
indulgent act of Rukkutta and Indorida, while the natives
themselves rubbed red ochre over the sacred stone of Arrolmolba,
and engaged in devotion. The act of rubbing red ochre
over the surface of the stone was supposed to incite the sexual
instinct of the men and to vivify the virile principle of the
tribe. By this performance the men believed they took from
the pregnant rock the embryonic rattappa which in the invisible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
form entered the wombs of the gins and subsequently
came to the world as the young representatives of the tribe
they called “<i>kadji kurreka</i>.”</p>

<p>Among the cave drawings of Australia, designs are here and
there met with depicting scenes from ceremonies having to do
with phallicism and other sex-worship. In the picture reproduced
from the Pigeon Hole district on the Victoria River (<a href="#figure09">Fig.
9</a>), one notices a man of the Kukadja type who was named
“<i>Mongarrapungja</i>” in the act of dancing around a sacred fire
with an ancestral female. The organ of the Kukadja, it will be
observed, passes into the flame, whence a column of smoke is
rising to find its way to the body of a gin which is drawn in
outline above the dancers. Here we have the representation
of a traditional ceremony associating the Kukadja’s phallus with
the impregnating medium supplied by fire, which, we have
already learned, may be looked for in the column of smoke.</p>

</figure>

<p>The Australian tribes, without exception, believe in the existence
of an evil spirit, or Demogorgon, who prowls their
camps at night. It is on this account that natives are loth to
leave the glare of the camp-fire, fearing they might be caught
and injured by the spirit. In reality, they picture this fellow
much as we do a ghost. Ordinarily he is invisible, and during
the day haunts the graves of the dead tribesmen. At nightfall
he opens the grave and walks about under cover of the dead
man’s skeleton; the natives often imagine they can hear the
bones rattling as he passes near them; and they shudder with
fear. It is on this account that they imagine the spirit to be
not brown like themselves, but white, the colour of bone. If
he catches anybody roaming alone, he will bite his victim in
the abdomen and the latter perceives an unpleasant feeling or
pain in that region. So far as one can ascertain, the symptoms
of this damage are those of an acute attack of dyspepsia. The
Arunndta call this ghost “<i>Iltdana</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>There is another evil creature which is at large after dark;
it is known by the Arunndta as “<i>Erinnja</i>.” It is supposed to
have fleshy parts, a tail, and large projecting teeth; it runs like
a dog, and possesses only one large toe on each foot. If it
catches anybody unawares, it will turn the captive’s head back
to front. The natives claim that this monster has a predilection
for opening people’s navels with a bone nose-stick. It
takes children from their mothers and ties them to trees for
the great mythical dogs to feed upon; for this reason the
terrified mothers often place meat outside their huts to appease
Erinnja’s hunger. The Nangarri or medicine men imagine
they can detect the presence of the brute when it is about, and
they immediately exhort the people by informing them of the
impending mischief.</p>

<p>At times it is necessary to protect a person or party from
likely harm or witchcraft emanating from the supposed presence
of an evil spirit. It may be that a warrior is indisposed and
is anticipating molestation, or a number of men may wish to
perform a sacred ceremony during which the evil spirit may
be thought an undesirable listener. The Nangarri or medicine
man alone has it in his power to exorcise the demon. And
after the surroundings have been clarified of all deterrent contamination,
he proceeds to mark off an area around the man
or party concerned with selected stones which he consecrates.
This area, mostly oval or circular in shape, remains a strict
taboo to all beyond its confines, and is believed to disenchant
any morbid influence the evil spirit may bring to bear upon it.
If, in the former case, he wishes to further protect his patient,
he places some green gum leaves over the sufferer’s body. Vide
<a href="#plate39">Plate XXXIX</a>.</p>

<p>Although a spiritual Evil Being is feared more than a Good
is revered, the existence of the latter is faithfully admitted, so
far as our personal experience goes, by both the central and
northern Australian tribes; and such a belief has, moreover,
been found by reliable observers among the now practically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
extinct tribes of southern Australia. According to the late
Dr. A. W. Howitt, the natives of Victoria and New South
Wales used to speak with bated breath of a great Supernatural
Being which once inhabited the earth and now lives in the sky.
The belief is original and not in any way due to missionary
influence. The oldest myths, such as only the untaught and
unsophisticated grey-beards can tell, contain references to the
existence on earth in ancestral times of convivial beings, kindly
disposed towards the people, who eventually found their way
to the sky by way of towering trees, since destroyed by fire.
The Supreme Being is called by the Arunndta “<i>Altjerra</i>,” by
the Fowler’s Bay natives “<i>Nyege</i>,” and by the Aluridja
“<i>Tukura</i>.” The benign Altjerra roams about the sky (“<i>Alkurra</i>”)
and keeps a watchful eye upon the doings of the tribes
beneath him. The natives are so convinced of his ubiquitous
presence that the Arunndta, for instance, have a favourite exclamation
when committing themselves on oath in the form of
“<i>Altjerr’m arrum</i>,” meaning something like “<i>Altjerra</i> hear it”;
that is, an appeal is made to Altjerra as witness to what is said,
much after the way a school child endeavours to convince one
of the truth of an utterance by exclaiming: “God strike me
dead if I tell a lie.”</p>

<p>The etymology of the Supreme Being’s name is often really
poetical. The Sunday Islanders, for instance, recognize such a
Super-Being whom they call “<i>Kaleya Ngungu</i>.” This name
embodies in it the ideas of the past as well as of the future.
“<i>Kaleya</i>” in that locality means the “finish” of anything, or
even “Good-bye,” while “ngung” stands for that which is to
come or is to be. The implication is that this Great Being has
emerged from the obscurity of bygone days and continues to
live into the still greater uncertainty of times ahead. From a
religious point of view, then, we note here a recognition of a
spiritual quantity whose influence has been exercised uninterruptedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
from the earliest past, and will be continued again,
and forever.</p>

<p>So, too, the name of the Aluridja God, “<i>Tukura</i>,” is composed
of two words expressing the ideas of genesis and eternity.
In the same sense, the Arunndta regard their demi-gods, or
“<i>Altjerrajarra namitjimma</i>,” as being the creators of life, although
as such they themselves continue to live uninterruptedly
and <i>ad infinitum</i>. And we have already noted that they roam
for ever in the great celestial “walk-about,” which is known as
“<i>Altjerringa</i>” by the Arunndta, “<i>Talleri</i>” by the Kukata, and
“<i>Wirrewarra</i>” by the Narrinyerri.</p>

<p>To this consummate home all spirits of the dead find their
way and there join their spirit ancestors. In fact, so many
have gone to the happy ground that most tribes look upon the
stars as the camp-fires and fire-sticks of their departed relatives
and friends. It is on this account that many stars have been
named after notable tribesmen, the natives imagining that they
can discover the new addition in the firmament after the deceased
has been interred. Whenever a shooting star is observed
travelling towards the earth, it is taken to be the spirit of one
returning temporarily to its terrestrial haunts.</p>

<p>No truer insight could be obtained into the mind of a primitive
man than by means of a psycho-analysis of his artistic
productions and predilections. Like most other peoples, past or
present, the Australian aboriginal has developed his talents to
an astonishing degree. Just as is true of his dances and musical
performances, the real value of a production can only be appreciated
by one who can throw himself, heart and soul, into the
responsive, reciprocative, and assimilative mood and atmosphere
the artist endeavours to create. The psychological factor is the
more important; an aboriginal’s design may be crude, but his
imagination is, nevertheless, wonderful; we see the line, but
he sees the life; we behold the image, he the form. In the
absence of such a psychological reciprocation, however, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
effect and quality of any artistic production may fall flat. Indeed,
we ask, what is contained in a mere line? With due
deference to the Euclidian definition, a line, from a primitive
point of view, might represent almost anything, provided the
necessary imagination is there; and it is just this imagination
which is particularly cultivated by the primitive man. The
question arises: “Who is the better artist: the man who can
satisfy himself or the man who can satisfy others?” The
former is unquestionably the more primitive idea of satisfaction.
Simplicity of design is by no means indicative of a deficiency
in talent, provided the inventor has evolved the necessary
imagination which permits him to behold in a design before
him the reality of the original. This instinct is common to all
mankind; we have only to observe our own children to appreciate
the excellence of their creative talent and imagination
when they are at play among themselves. Modern adult man
is too realistic, perhaps too unnatural; he cries for something
tangible, something concrete to appease his tastes. Just as one
often sees youngsters, European as well as aboriginal, playing
at their favourite game of “father and mother,” assuming
certain inanimate objects, like sticks, to represent their children,
so the aboriginal artist’s imaginative mind can actually see the
real living picture contained in the crude diagram before him;
he conveys his thoughts to his fellows by means of a lengthy
verbal explanation, and, when they have caught the idea, they
can wax as enthusiastic over the thing as the artist himself.
This sentiment we have sacrificed to a certain extent. It is
difficult to say exactly who is an artist and who is not. By
nature we are all artists, and most of us can satisfy our individual
needs in a more or less conventional way. But to pose
as a modern artist, it is required of us to be able to take the
inspiration from Nature and reproduce it in such a way that
others are able to grasp the significance or beauty of the design
without more explanation than a mere title. Yet the conception<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
of “art” is a variable and relative measure, and we
know well there have been different tendencies and schools,
some of which are so highly specialized that the untrained mind
cannot grasp, or even admire, the quality of the reproduction,
because it cannot see with the same eye as the artist specialist.
Here, then, we have a reversion to the primitive instinct, combined
with all the perfections and skill which culture and
training have evolved during the long space of time lying between
a primitive foundation and the high standard of modern
excellence.</p>

<p>The oldest records of primitive art in Australia are preserved
in the form of carvings upon rock surfaces, akin to those
found in parts of Europe, South Africa, and Egypt. The
technique of these carvings is twofold. At Port Jackson, and
elsewhere along the coast of New South Wales, and to a small
extent at Port Hedland in Western Australia, a great variety
of representations of fish, animals, and men have been cut and
scraped in outline into the surface of the rock; in the Mann
Ranges also, certain nondescript designs were found lightly
scratched upon the surface of some diorite outcrops with a
fragment of rock. At different points in the northern Flinders
Ranges, at Yunta, at Eureowie in New South Wales, on the
Flinders and Burnett Rivers in Queensland, and also at Port
Hedland in Western Australia, an extensive series of designs
occurs which has been chipped into the rocks with the aid of
pointed stone chisels. The carvings at Port Hedland and those
in the Flinders Ranges are very old indeed. In fact, they are
so old that none of the tribes now living remember anything
about them, and refer to them as being the handicraft of the
Evil Spirit.</p>

<p>The most striking feature about the Port Jackson carvings
is the large size of individual designs, some of the fish measuring
nearly thirty feet in length, and some of the kangaroo over ten
feet in height. That the carvings have been made for generations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
past is evident from the fact that in places a practically
obliterated design has been covered, and re-covered, with new
designs.</p>

<p>At Port Hedland there are many acres of a low limestone
plateau literally covered with carvings, many of which are
badly weather-beaten; several of the carvings are of the scraped
type found at Port Jackson. The accompanying illustrations
depict a chosen number of the Port Hedland designs drawn
to scale.</p>

<p>Among them we observe: Two turtles (<i>Figs.</i> 1 and 2), the
one of which (<i>Fig.</i> 1) being shown in a dorsal aspect, the other
(<i>Fig.</i> 2) apparently in a ventral; two large fish (<i>Figs.</i> 3 and 4)
resembling the Port Jackson type; a lizard track (<i>Fig.</i> 5),
showing the trail of the tail in the centre; a human foot-print
(<i>Fig.</i> 7), with an emu track above it; a large stingray (<i>Fig.</i> 8),
with protruding eyes and long tail standing erect; a shark’s
liver (<i>Fig.</i> 9), at any rate, it was described as such by a native;
a stingray’s liver (<i>Fig.</i> 10); an emu track (<i>Fig.</i> 11); a lizard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
(<i>Fig.</i> 12); shields (<i>Figs.</i> 16, 18, 19, 21, 30), variously decorated;
boomerangs (<i>Figs.</i> 14, 15, 20, 27, 28, 32), variously
decorated; spear-throwers (<i>Figs.</i> 22 and 31); a corrobboree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
plume (<i>Fig.</i> 33), such as is worn in the hair or stuck in the
armlets during many of the ceremonial dances; pubic tassels
(<i>Figs.</i> 34, 35, 36), used as a covering, suspended from a hair
belt; a “circle-within-circle” design (<i>Fig.</i> 39), often figuring
conspicuously among emblematic and ceremonial patterns; a
human foot-print (<i>Fig.</i> 37); a dog track (<i>Fig.</i> 38); a lizard
(<i>Fig.</i> 41); a group of figures (<i>Fig.</i> 40), consisting of a spiral,
of similar significance as <i>Fig.</i> 39, a chain of turkey tracks on
the right, and three paired tracks of a bounding wallaby on
the left. One or two of the remaining smaller figures are of
doubtful meaning, the most remarkable being <i>Fig.</i> 25, which
for an aboriginal ideograph is extraordinarily complex and
symmetrical.</p>

</figure>

<p>We shall next consider a number of figures in this series
which have to do with the human form. In some cases the
attempts at representing the human body have been very crude
(<i>Figs.</i> 17, 45, 46), and it would be difficult to recognize the
results if it were not for the association of these figures with
others in which the human form is more evident. In <i>Fig.</i> 13
we behold a man whose attitude suggests that he is either
walking or dancing; in all probability the former, because his
body is not in any way decorated to suggest a ceremony. But
when we look at <i>Fig.</i> 42, our attention is drawn to the fact
that the man there represented is wearing a pubic tassel hanging
from his belt, carrying a tall head-gear, and has tribal markings
or scars upon his chest; moreover, in this case the eyes and
mouth are shown, but not the nose. In <i>Figs.</i> 6, 43, and 44,
pubic appendages are shown, which in all probability are intended
to represent a hair tassel in the first instance, and pearl
shell in the others; head-gears are also indicated. All the
figures have the arms extended as if a dancing attitude were
attempted by the artist. It is most unusual to find all the
facial features, including the chin, represented as in <i>Fig.</i> 44.
There is no neck shown in any of the last-mentioned figures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
although in other cases (<i>Fig.</i> 13) it is clearly indicated. It
will be observed that in several of the figures (<i>Figs.</i> 6, 42, 44),
the feet are represented by their tracks. The only remaining
figure is that of a dancing gin (<i>Fig.</i> 29), the characteristic
position of whose arms suggests the dance during which they
hold a skein of hair or fibre-string between their hands to jerk
it to and fro.</p>

<p>A real illustration of the Port Hedland type of carving is
presented in <a href="#plate40">Plate XL</a>, 1, but owing to the carving occurring
upon a horizontal plane, the tilting of the camera, which was
necessary, has rather seriously distorted the design. A correct
copy is, however, included among the designs reproduced on
<a href="#Page_300">page 300</a> (<i>Fig.</i> 10, 6).</p>

<p>Turning now to the pre-historic carvings of the Flinders
Ranges and other localities cited, it would be impossible to
discuss the enormous number of designs in anything like detail,
without unduly burdening the dimensions of this volume. At
certain places, like Deception Creek and Yunta, the carvings
are so numerous that it is difficult to find a space entirely devoid
of any; the places are deserving of being ranked as primitive
art galleries, and every endeavour should be made to preserve
them as such. Considerable care must have been taken in the
execution of these carvings, since either the outline or the
entire area of every design has been diligently chipped away.
And the work of hours must have run into the labour of years,
yea, of generations, because at one or two spots like Yunta one
design has been carved over the top of another, time after
time, until eventually the ground appeared as though it were
covered with an elaborate carpet. A few illustrations only
will be selected to serve as types of the handiwork to be found
in such great profusion.</p>

<p>In the first picture (<a href="#plate40">Plate XL</a>, 2), a design will be observed
near the centre consisting of seven parallel vertical lines lying
beneath a horizontal band. From what we have learned above,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
we shall have no difficulty in recognizing the shape of a pubic
tassel or apron, so commonly used throughout Australia. Immediately
to the left of this is the image of a long lizard clearly
and wholly intagliated into the rock; whilst just above the tassel,
and a little to the right of it, stands the form of a creature
with two legs, a plump body, two large eyes (appearing like
circles at the top), and an elevated beak between them—this
is the representation of an owl! About midway between owl
and lizard is a small mark resembling an inverted broad arrow
which stands for the track of a bustard, commonly called wild
turkey.</p>

<p>The next illustration (<a href="#plate41">Plate XLI</a>, 1) may, for convenience of
discussion, be divided into two halves by the joint-fissure which
is seen running vertically down the middle of the picture. In the
centre of the left-hand half, the dark, and deeply pitted, shape
of a human foot-print, with the toes pointing upwards, will be
apparent. Upon the brightly illuminated surface above it,
the vertical strands of a pubic tassel are indistinctly visible;
whilst on the left of the foot-print a small wallaby track has
been cut, in which the long median toes, as well as the lateral,
have been truly imitated. Beneath the latter, upon the elevated
portion of rock, is a single corrobboree circle. But the most
interesting figure is near the centre of the right-hand half of
the picture; the creature it most resembles is the duck-billed
platypus. The “duck-bill” is very conspicuous, whilst the head,
the plump body, and the stumpy tail all agree with the appearance
of the platypus, even to the claws, which are clearly seen
on the right hind leg. It is, of course, possible that the carving
was intended to stand for a native “hedge-hog” or <i>Echidna</i>,
but the former explanation would seem more true to Nature.
The remaining carvings are principally representations of the
paired spoors of wallaby and kangaroo.</p>

<p>The following two photographs (<a href="#plate41">Plate XLI</a>, 2, and <a href="#plate42">Plate
XLII</a>, 1) present similar subjects, the carvings consisting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
an array of corrobboree circles, human foot-prints, and tracks
of wallaby, kangaroo, and turkey. A new feature is contained
in the upper illustration in the shape of the claws of kangaroo
or possibly of the human hand; these are seen in the top right-hand
quarter.</p>

</figure>

<p>It will be admitted that these primitive carvings or petroglyphs
of the northern Flinders Ranges have more than a
passing resemblance to the ancient graffiti of Egypt. It will be
noticed, too, that the last illustration includes a slab of rock
upon which some of the designs only occur in part. This is
because the slab has fallen from its original position, since the
carvings were made upon it; and so, at several points, portion
of a design can be seen upon a rock lying in the valley, whilst
the piece belonging to it might be detected, still <i>in situ</i>, up in
a cliff. This in itself seems to suggest that the work of ages
has been going on since the ancient artists put their talents
to a test.</p>

<p>It is astounding to what height above the level of the ground
the natives must have climbed to decorate the rock faces with
their carvings; in many instances atmospheric denudation has
so altered the shape of the cliffs that it would be impossible at
the present day to reach some of the designs, to say nothing
of finding a footing to undertake the carving.</p>

<p>But more, several cases were observed where a design was
bisected by a gaping fissure; all the evidence was in favour of
the separated portions of the design having originally been
contiguous, but subsequent earth movement had forced them
asunder. In addition to the actual cleft existing between the
two portions of a design, cases were noted where a slight
faulting had occurred along the fissure, through which one side
of the disrupted design stood at a measurably higher level than
the other.</p>

<p>The strongest geological evidence in support of the great
antiquity of these carvings, however, is in the presence of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
dark rust-coloured <i>patina</i> or glossy surface film which everywhere
covers the exposures of the rock and carvings as well.
These protective films are characteristic of all desert and arid
regions. In Egypt, it has been ascertained that the presence
of the patina is a ready means of distinguishing primitive
carvings from those made within historic reckoning. Professor
G. Schweinfurth, the famous Egyptologist, has pointed out that
whereas the prehistoric carvings are covered by the patina, the
incised hieroglyphics of even the fifth and sixth Dynasty at
El Kab are as fresh-looking as though they had been carved
yesterday. In some of the Australian examples there is no
appreciable difference between the thickness of the film on the
rock and that covering the design; in others the designs look
quite fresh, or, if they show anything at all, it is but a rudimentary
glaze. The conclusion is that some of the Australian
designs must, upon this evidence alone, be regarded as extremely
old.</p>

<p>But there is further evidence. If we could definitely claim
the platypus design as authentic, it would mean that the ancient
artist was familiar with the form of an animal which at the
present time is quite unknown in central Australia. But geology
tells us that in times gone by, in the Pliocene period,
perhaps even later, all the great lake systems of the Australian
interior were not salt, as they are now, but fresh water. Under
those conditions, it is quite feasible that the duck-billed monotreme
might easily have lived in that region; if so, it might
have supplied prehistoric man in Australia with a model he
perpetuated in the rocks.</p>

<p>The platypus design is by no means unique. Among the
carvings at Yunta there are several depicting the spoor of a
very large animal, which are rounded at one end like a heel
and have four or five serrations resembling toe-marks at the
other. The picture is not unlike that of a wombat track, but
the dimensions are far too great. The Yunta “tracks” measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
nearly ten inches in length and are practically the same in
width. There is no animal living in Australia at the present
time whose track would be anything like as large; the
nearest known animal which might answer the form of the
carving would perhaps be that of a hippopotamus. This animal
is, of course, not indigenous to Australia, but we know that an
extinct animal, probably not unlike a hippopotamus, used to
roam the fertile plains of central Australia in Pliocene times;
that was the <i>Diprotodon</i>. In the accompanying sketch I have
placed a tracing of the Yunta carving beside one of the reconstructed
<i>manus</i> of the Diprotodon, and one must admit that
there is a plausible agreement between the two. Vide <a href="#figure13">Fig. 13</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>An aboriginal never exaggerates the dimensions of a track
when drawing from Nature. Upon this point, indeed, he is
most exacting, because upon an accurate knowledge of and
familiarity with such things his very livelihood depends, and
the acquisition of accuracy represents part of the recognized
standard of his educational system. He would never, for instance,
draw the track of a wallaby larger than it is in reality,
because confusion would immediately arise as to whether it
might not be that of a kangaroo or euro; and if he drew it
smaller than it actually is, doubt would be raised as to whether
it might not represent the track of a kangaroo-rat, or even of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
a marsupial mouse. So, too, when he wishes to draw a turkey
track, he has to be careful, because if he makes it bigger than
it should be, it might be mistaken for that of an emu; and if
he makes it smaller, people who see the track might take it to
be that of a curlew, or even of a plover.</p>

<p>For the above reason alone, a native would never draw the
track of a wombat on the elaborate scale of the Yunta carving.
Furthermore, there are some exceptionally large bird tracks
carved into the rocks at Balparana, in the Flinders Ranges,
which seem too big to be intended for those of an emu; the
question might reasonably be asked whether they could not have
been made by a primitive hunter at a time when the now extinct
“moa” or <i>Genyornis</i> still lived in Australia.</p>

<p>A type of decorative art quite similar to the ancient rock
carvings, though on a much smaller scale, is to be found on
the stone-tjuringas of the Arunndta, Tjingali, and other central
Australian tribes. The designs, like those on the wooden objects,
consist largely of engraved circles, straight and sinuous
lines, and tracks of totemic significance. The intaglios are
usually tinted with red ochre.</p>

<p>Leaving the discussion of carved rocks and stones for the
time being, and directing our attention to the subject of carved
trees, we find that this interesting cult flourished principally in
the tribal territories which are now included in the State of
New South Wales and the extreme southern portion of Queensland,
the haunts of tribes now practically extinct.</p>

<p>The design or decoration was either carved straight into the
bark, or the latter was previously removed and the cutting done
in the sapwood or heartwood. Great variety was displayed
in the choice of designs. Some were crude and unshapely,
others neatly and cleanly cut and of intricate pattern; among
them were perfect geometrical designs, consisting of groups of
circles and quadrilateral figures, usually concentric and often
combined with parallel, wavy, zig-zag, or spiral lines; yet another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
class of design would consist of some animal or human
form, more or less grotesquely modified.</p>

<p>The object of this elaborate tree-carving was of a twofold
nature. Firstly a certain number of trees would be so treated,
within the immediate surroundings of the grave of a notable
tribesman, to permanently mark the place of sepulchre; and,
secondly, the butt of a tree commanding the ground of an initiation
ceremony might have been so distinguished, if the importance
of the occasion warranted it.</p>

<p>Along the north-west coast of Australia, where the boabab
tree flourishes, the tribes often carve animalistic and other
designs into the bark, which, on account of its softness, lends
itself admirably for the purpose. The carvings are usually to
be found near a camp or at the site of an ordinary corroboree
ground. The designs, once they have been cut into the bark,
remain there during the life of the tree. The accompanying
illustration (<a href="#plate42">Plate XLII</a>, 2) depicts an emu, which stands three
feet high, carved into a boabab off King Sound, Western
Australia. The whole of the bark within the area occupied by
the design has been removed. The feet, it will be observed,
are portrayed in a perfectly free way in order to leave no doubt
in the mind of an observer as to the track the bird actually
makes. Two other figures stood beside the emu, cut in a similar
way into the bark of the same tree; one was a snake, a shade
over five feet in length, the other an emu track.</p>

<p>In place of the carved trees, the Melville and Bathurst
Islanders erect carved and painted posts around the graves of
their people—men, women, and children alike. These pillars,
which are of hard and heavy wood, are from four to six feet
high, circular in section, and have the top carved into a “head”
of one or other of the patterns drawn in the accompanying
figure. The top of the pillar is either flat, rounded, or pointed,
the “head” being formed by cutting one or more circumferential
grooves of chosen width, and at chosen distances, below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
the top. At times an oblong hole is cut transversely through
the post five or six inches from the top, leaving only two narrow
strips of timber, one on either side, to support the “head” thus
formed. Vide <a href="#figure14">Fig. 14</a>.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 14. Carved grave posts of Melville and Bathurst Islanders (× 1/40).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Designs and patterns quite similar to, but on a smaller
scale than those cut on trees, are found carved upon weapons
of some of the tribes. Shields and spear-throwers are those
most commonly found decorated with incised patterns. Some
of the hardwood shields of the River Murray tribes are richly
incised with parallel, zig-zag, and geniculate lines, and with
squares standing point to point in a longitudinal line, all the
spaces between the squares being filled in with parallel
“elbows.” The Worora tribe at Port George IV, on the
other hand, decorate their shields with fantastic representations
of snakes, emus, and tracks of various animals. The light-wood
shields of central Australia are destitute of any ornamentation
except wide and shallow longitudinal grooves, which
are also characteristic of the bark food-carriers in use all over
the continent of Australia.</p>

<p>So far as spear-throwers are concerned, the handsomely
carved specimens produced by the natives of the Warburton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
and Gascoyne Rivers, and of the King Leopold Ranges in
Western Australia, deserve special mention. The favourite
pattern in that region appears to be longitudinal geniculate
bands, alternately incised lengthwise and crosswise, together
giving the effect of a false herring-bone motive. A new element
is introduced in wood-carving in the ceremonial spear-throwers
of central Australian tribes by the inclusion of the concentric
circles pattern already referred to; the Arunndta in particular
produce some very showy specimens on gala occasions. The
decoration is very finely graved upon the inner flat surface.
The old Victorian types occasionally had pictures of animals,
birds, and men carved upon them.</p>

<p>Boomerangs are often decorated with incised patterns, but
more frequently the decoration is only lightly graved into the
wood with the point of a stone-knife or with the sharp cutting
edge of a shell, tooth, or bone. From an art point of view,
the finest productions come from the north of Western Australia.
The King Leopold Ranges natives cover one whole
side of their boomerangs with an incised pattern, consisting
usually of parallel geniculate lines, false herring-bone, or concentric
rhomboids posed along a median line. Some of the
most attractive specimens, however, come from the Pidunga
tribe at Broome. These natives covered both surfaces of the
missile with a wonderful variety of designs, which included
excellent representations of emu, kangaroo, snakes, crocodiles,
turtle, tracks of every description, dancing men, corrobboree
circles, and many decorative designs. Other articles, such as
adze-handles, tjuringas, and message sticks, are carved after
much the same fashion.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp56" id="figure15" style="max-width: 18.75em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 15. Ochre drawing, Glenelg River, Western Australia (× 1/8).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is yet another class of incised decorative art to record
which is found in the far north of Western Australia. The
King Sound and other natives of the northern Kimberley
district have developed a cult quite peculiar to themselves, in
that they carve ornate designs upon the brown surface of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
large nuts of the boabab. The method they have adopted is
to hold the nut firmly in the left hand and work the designs
into the dark, outer layer of the shell with the sharp point of
a bone, or, as is the case nowadays, with the point of a piece
of iron wire or of a pocket knife. The instrument is held in
the right hand, with the four fingers against the palm, while
the thumb is laid straight along it on top. The nut is steadied
against the body whilst the point of the instrument is applied
from the distant side. By applying semi-rotary movements
with the hand, the point is made to plough forwards, and by
so doing the thin, brown surface-skin is broken and falls away,
leaving a white, and slightly jagged, line upon a dark background.
Many are the designs which cover the surface of a
boabab nut; and it must be admitted the artists exercise considerable
judgment in the grouping of the subjects displayed.
Among the more important figures are included animals, birds,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
reptiles, fish, and human beings, besides many of a more complicated
and less apparent nature. Vide <a href="#plate43">Plate XLIII</a>, 1.</p>

<p>The north-western tribes, from Broome to Wyndham, and to
a lesser extent those of the Northern Territory, artistically
decorate the pearl-shell coverings they wear suspended from
the belt by cutting designs into the smooth surface of the inner
shell of the oyster. By rubbing powdered red ochre into the
portions thus roughened, the carvings stand out in bold contrast
against the nacreous background. The designs are largely conventional
and often embody the human form; a few tracks of
animals or of birds are also occasionally added.</p>

Australia (× 3/5). Tracing.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unlike his racial relative, who used to live in Europe during
the Stone Age, the Australian aboriginal does not pay much
attention to the carving of bone. The little he does, in fact,
is more utilitarian than artistic. We have had occasion to
note that the old Murray River tribes used to make the points
of their spear-throwers of bone. In central Australia a wing
bone of the pelican is cut at both ends and worn through the
septum of the nose; occasionally one end is plugged with
triodia resin whilst the hollow in the opposite end carries a
plume. Not infrequently the slender ulna of a kangaroo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
serves a similar purpose; the shaft is cut about six inches from
one end and sharpened by scraping it with a stone fragment;
the condyles are left intact to represent the head of the pin.
Two types of bone fish-hooks have already been referred to.</p>

<p>The central tribes make a useful gouge out of a strong
hollow bone of the kangaroo or dingo by splitting it longitudinally
and grinding down its ends on the slope. The implement
thus fashioned has a sharp, bevelled, semi-cylindrical
cutting edge at either one or both ends.</p>

<p>We now come to the consideration of another big and important
branch of primitive art, which comprises the charcoal,
kaolin, and ochre drawings of the aboriginal of Australia. As
did his palæolithic relative in the Old World, the aboriginal
during the rainy season spends much of his time under the
cover of overhanging rock shelters, well within the cheerful
influence of his never-failing fire. Moreover, in mid-summer
months, when the heat of the sun becomes intense, he often
finds his way to the same haunts to have the full benefit of
the shade the solid walls of rock produce. Congregated under
these conditions, there are always some who spend their time
in decorating the surrounding walls of the cave. This may be
done for purely æsthetic reasons, or as the result of a discussion,
or, indeed, to sanctify the abode and so to make it impregnable
to the Evil Spirit. Whatever the reason may be,
the mere act of drawing a figure upon the wall by a recognized
artist always solicits the patronage of many, who will follow
the different manipulations of the entertainer with considerable
interest. There are usually a few men in every tribe who have
established a reputation as artists; and their work is prized by
the heads and protected by tribal law from the hands of
vandals who would at a frivolous moment deface or disfigure
a work of art which the tribe is proud to look upon as their
own. It is gratifying to observe that there is very little tendency
on the part of the aboriginal, humble as he is, to destroy
wantonly or deliberately a work designed to create an environment
for him during his leisure or to protect his body and kin
against aggression by evil during the darkness of night.</p>

<p>Usually the interior of rock shelters and caves has, in consequence
of long ages of weathering and mineral precipitation,
become deeply stained and dark in colour. In addition, the
continued burning of fires within has helped to smut the stony
roof. This condition makes an admirable background for the
application of colour. Where the wall is black, charcoal
naturally finds no favour, and the pigments available are reduced
to white, yellow, and red.</p>

<p>Pipe-clay and ochres are always stocked in quantity; not a
tribe in the whole of Australia has ever been known to be
without them. Where the tribal ground is not in possession
of natural deposits, supplies are obtained from a neighbouring
tribe, it may be from considerable distance, by barter or by an
actual expedition to the ochre mine.</p>

<p>In quite the same sense as modern peoples refer to red ochre
as blood-stone, the natives of Australia connect the formation
of the natural, red pigment with blood mythologically.</p>

<p>There is a fine deposit of red ochre in the Flinders Ranges,
near Parachilna, which for ages past has supplied more than
one tribe with pigment; the mine was known as Yarrakinna.
The ochre was regarded as the blood of a sacred emu which
was there killed by a horde of wild dogs. From time immemorial
the “Salt-water Tribe” used to send a number of
its men across from Queensland to obtain a large supply of
the precious stone at the spot and return with it to their
native ground.</p>

<p>The expedition would be under the leadership of an old man,
and his party would consist of young men who had recently
been initiated. The journey was a long and arduous undertaking,
and young fellows were selected in order that their
strength and powers of endurance might be put to the test.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
When they reached to within a certain stage of the mine, the
old man ordered everybody to discard any belongings he might
be carrying, and, upon a given signal, the party, led by the
old man, began to run towards a big hill which stood before
them. Many a hurdle was in their way, but it was imperative
that they kept running. Then they took the sloping ground,
and presently a large boulder lay in front of them; this the
young men were informed was the petrified dog which had
killed the emu. Each in his turn was asked to throw a stone
at it as he skipped by. Next, they came upon a group of stones
which they were told represented the cursed remains of the
female dog and pups. As the names of these were mentioned,
each of the men again threw stones.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure18" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure18.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 18. Boomerang with a number of emu designs carved upon it,

</figure>

<p>Suddenly the party was ordered to halt. Just ahead of them
was the platform of rock upon which the sacred emu had
expired. The men were requested to remain where they stood
and to keep silent whilst the old fellow made for a chasm below
the platform. He returned not long after, with his hands full
of rich red ochre, which he rubbed over the bodies of his young
attendants. Thereupon all present cut off their beards, which
they had been wearing long purposely for the occasion, and
walked in a body to the chasm. “The great Emu wants
feathers,” they exclaimed, “we offer her the token of our manhood”;
and, as they spoke, they threw the beards into the chasm
below. Then each man was allowed to fill his bag with red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
ochre, and, placing it upon his head, he ran down the hill to
the place at which he left his belongings. Nobody was allowed
to look back; and should, by accident, a bag of ochre be dropped
on the way, it had to be left just where it fell, and under no
circumstances picked up again.</p>

<p>According to the Kukata, there was once an old man who
had several wild dogs, which were ferocious in habit, generally,
but obeyed their master. One day, when he was out hunting,
he saw the track of a kangaroo which he made up his mind
to follow. He had his little daughter with him, and, not
thinking it advisable to take her with him into the scrub, he
decided to leave her to play on a clay-pan while he followed
his prey into the hills. He captured the kangaroo and returned
to the clay-pan, but imagine his disgust when he found that his
dogs had, during his absence, killed his child and devoured
her flesh.</p>

<p>In his wrath, the old man chased the dogs into the hills at
the point of his spears, until eventually he drove them into a
cave, the entrance of which he closed with a number of large
stones. The wounded dogs in their plight attacked one another
and tore themselves to pieces. In consequence, their blood
poured freely into the cave and soaked deeply into the rocks.
Ever since, the tribe have gone to that cave to collect supplies
of the “blood-stained” rock—the red ochre—which they require
for their ceremonies and corrobborees.</p>

<p>Ochre and pipe-clay, which form an article for inter-tribal
barter, are carried from one tribe to another in oblong parcels
contained in bark wraps, which are folded at the ends and
kept together with fibre-string. Small quantities are always
carried by the men in their chignons and dilly bags, and, when
larger supplies are required for special occasions, they are
consigned to the care of the women.</p>

<p>When ochre is required for decorative purposes, it is necessary
to reduce it to a fine powder. This is done by placing a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
measured amount upon a level surface of rock and grinding it
with the aid of a medium-sized pebble. Hand-mills of this
description are to be found at any sites which natives have
been in the habit of embellishing with their drawings; they
may be recognized as small, shallow depressions scooped into
the surface by the continued abrasion of the hand-piece. Where
there is no flat, natural surface available, the grinding is done
upon portable slabs the women carry around from one camp
to another.</p>

</figure>

<p>The ochre (or pipe-clay), having been finely ground, it is
collected upon a piece of bark, or in a bark food-carrier, and
mixed with sufficient water to make a thick paste; and it is
ready for application. The Bathurst Islanders use the large,
concave shells of <i>Cyrena</i> in much the same way as European
artists formerly used the valves of fresh-water mussels (<i>Unio
pictorum</i>) for mixing their pigments in.</p>

<p>The native spreads the paint with his fingers, where larger
surfaces are concerned, and with a short stick where finer lines
or details are to be added. The Bathurst Islanders cut short
pieces off the green shoots of the lawyer-cane (<i>Calamus</i>) and
chew one or both ends of the sticks until all the fibres have
been separated; these then fulfil the same purpose as the paint
brushes of a modern artist.</p>

<p>A favourite practice, and one which is met with all over
the continent, is to obtain a “negative” shape of a person’s
hand. This is done in the following way: The person puts a
small handful of ochre or pipe-clay into his mouth and crunches
it to a pulp; then he fills his mouth with water and thoroughly
mixes the contents. He holds the hand he wishes to stencil
against a flat surface, spacing the fingers at equal distances, and
spurts the contents of his mouth all about it. A short while
after, the hand is withdrawn. The area which it covered remains
in its natural condition, whilst the space surrounding it
has adopted the colour of the ochre or clay. Very often the
“hand” is subsequently painted over with a colour different from
that of the surrounding area. The Arunndta refer to the
hand-marks as “<i>ilja imbadja</i>.” Vide <a href="#plate44">Plate XLIV</a>.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure21" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 21. Charcoal drawing of hopping kangaroos, Pigeon Hole, Victoria
River (× 1/6). Tracing.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A native attaches considerable importance to his identity
being thus recorded and preserved in some of the caves, believing
the brand to stand for his individuality with as much
certitude as, say, the European who leaves his card or carves
his name in stone or wood. It is compulsory for members of
a certain rank in the Worora tribe to have their “hand-shadows”
perpetuated upon the walls of caves in which the
bones of their ancestors are reposed, because the spirits of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
dead are thus supposed to be apprised of any visits which have
been made to their last earthly resting places.</p>

<p>It is beyond dispute that the natives possess the faculty of
being able to recognize the hand-marks of their relatives and
tribesmen, even though they may not have been present when
they were made.</p>

<p>Less frequently, the negative imprint process is applied to a
person’s feet or any of his private belongings, such as stone
tomahawks. At times, too, the hand is smeared over with
ochre and then smacked against a surface to obtain a positive.
Vide <a href="#plate44">Plate XLIV</a>, 2.</p>

<p>The number of ochre drawings one finds on rock surfaces is
naturally unlimited, especially when extending observations
over the whole of Australia; and the variety in regard to
subject, colour, composition, and execution is correspondingly
large.</p>

<p>Without at this stage attempting to delve deeply into the
consideration of individual designs and their artistic merits,
let us cast our eyes for a moment upon an illustration, which
might be considered typical, to familiarize ourselves with the
general appearance of Australian cave drawings (<a href="#plate45">Plate XLV</a>,
1). We have before us a rock shelter or <i>abris</i> on the Forrest
River in the north of Western Australia, a more or less vertical
wall at the base, overhung at the top by a solid ledge or “roof”
of quartzite. For the better part of the day this spot is protected
from the intense heat of a tropical sun; and during the “wet
season,” also, it provides a shelter from the prolific rains. But a
casual glance at the picture suffices to convince one of the
presence of a number of conspicuous designs drawn in ochre
upon the rock faces. One in particular, that of a huge snake,
immediately catches the eye, but if a careful scrutiny of the
lower portion of the escarpment is made, many other smaller
designs will be discovered.</p>

<p>When the rocky background is light-coloured, and not sooty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
the artists often include charcoal drawings among the coloured
ochre designs. The native applies the charcoal either in the
form of a powder with the aid of his fingers, or he selects a
piece of charred wood, big enough to hold between his fingers,
and this he uses after the fashion a modern artist does a crayon.
According to the method employed, the result is either a figure
blackened all over, or a line drawing, shaded here and there.
Some particularly creditable charcoal drawings were obtained
near Pigeon Hole on the Victoria River in the Northern Territory;
these are described later.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp42" id="figure22" style="max-width: 14.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure22.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 22. Bark-drawing depicting an eagle-hawk clawing and tearing
the carcass of a wallaby, Port Darwin.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>An aboriginal not only paints the sides of the caves he temporarily
occupies, but he also delights in decorating the sheets
of bark which in certain districts, such as the north coast of
Australia and Melville and Bathurst Islands, are used for
making his huts waterproof. The method he adopts in applying
ochre to bark is precisely similar to that already considered in
connection with his cave drawings. And we might at the
same time extend these remarks to the decorative designs which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
appear in such profusion upon his spears, shields, boomerangs,
spear-throwers, waddies, clubs, food and water carriers, dilly
bags, ceremonial objects, personal ornaments, and, in fact, anything
he has occasion to manufacture and handle.</p>

<p>A special variety of ochre drawing which may justify a few
remarks is the tribal body decoration. We know that as a
simple, but effective, means of protecting his skin against the
weather, an aboriginal periodically anoints his body with emu
fat; moreover, to evade detection by the game he is stalking,
he often covers his body with ochre, earth, or clay to simulate
the colour of his surroundings as nearly as possible. But for
reasons, to him entirely cosmetic, he finds occasion to rub red
ochre powder (and charcoal also) over his face and body.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure23" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure23.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 23. Pipe-clay drawing of man and dogs, Humbert River (× 1/12).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>He has a distinct liking for the beautiful and does not
hesitate to avail himself of anything which might tend to make
his person more attractive looking by the application of colour.
Not only the sire, but the whole family endeavour to improve
their swarthy appearance by painting ornate designs over different
regions of their bodies. Longitudinal, parallel bands of
red, yellow, or black, extending up the legs, back, and abdomen,
together with transverse lines on the chest, shoulders, upper
arms, and outer surfaces of thighs, are symmetrically drawn,
and connected here and there (as, for instance, on the chest or
back) by lattice patterns and concentric circles. Parents are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
very proud of their children thus decorated. On the Forrest
River, a favourite mode is to draw a broad step-ladder-like
pattern from the ankles up the front surfaces of the legs, continuing
this up the trunk to about the level of the nipples, and
then circling outwards, down an arm on either side, to run out
at the elbow. This design is usually painted in yellow.</p>

</figure>

<p>We have frequently referred to the fact that during corrobborees
and ceremonial dances, the bodies of the performers
are decorated. White pipe-clay is one of the principal pigments
used, although red ochre is also much in evidence. In the
performance of ceremonies, we learned that a common motive
embodied in the decorations was the human skeleton. The
quickest, and perhaps most effective, way of whitening the face
in the representation of the skull is for the performer to
literally “wash” it in finely crushed pipe-clay. To accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
this, he scoops a quantity of the material with his hands,
and, closing his eyes, rubs the stuff all over his face and
possibly his head, too. By this process even the eyelids are
thoroughly whitened. The other lines, horizontal and vertical,
which are to represent the bones, he rubs on to the body with
his fingers (<a href="#plate46">Plate XLVI</a>).</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure25" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 25. Charcoal sketch of native spearing kangaroo, Pigeon Hole,
Victoria River (× 2/5). Tracing.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another method is to apply the paint in the form of a water
mixture, similar to that described when discussing the ochre
drawings. For this purpose, especially when an important event
is pending, a number of men are chosen to attend to the
“make up” of the performers. The assistants kneel beside
those who are to act, and apply the paste with their fingers.
The most delicate parts to handle are the eyelids. The actor
is required to close his eyes whilst the artist carefully applies
the paste to the lids; but it occasionally happens that some of
the material slips on to the eyeball and is rubbed against it
before the sufferer can give the alarm. Vide <a href="#plate45">Plate XLV</a>, 2.</p>

<p>We have already referred to the coloured down decorations
which are attached with human blood to the bodies of the performers
taking part in sacred and other ceremonies, and we
have also mentioned a ground drawing known as “<i>Etominja</i>”
(<a href="#plate37">Plate XXXVII</a>), which is constructed in a similar way. Some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
of the latter (e.g. the “walk-about” of the “<i>Tjilba Purra Altjerra
Knaninja</i>”) are very large; others, as for instance that
connected with the “<i>Erriakutta</i>” or yelka ceremony, are constructed
over the entire surface of mounds which cover many
square feet of ground.</p>

<p>Having briefly reviewed the different methods of art production
in vogue in Australia, we shall proceed to consider a
number of the designs in greater detail, deduce their origin,
trace their evolution, and, where possible, give their interpretation.
It will be realized at the outset that some of the
designs are crude in the extreme, whilst others are undeniably
shapely and quite up to the standard of an average European’s
artistic proficiency. The latter remarks apply best to actual
representations of natural forms. It must be remembered that
the artistic reproductions an aboriginal makes are invariably
from memory; the primitive artist never draws with a model
in front of him. If we were to ask a number of Europeans to
draw, say a horse from memory, there is no doubt we should
receive a great variety of results in response to our request. So,
among the aboriginal artists, there is a great diversity of talent
which is more individual than tribal.</p>

<p>If, for instance, we study the different attempts at representing
the form of one of the most familiar subjects we could
ask an aboriginal to experiment upon—the ubiquitous kangaroo
—we should find by comparison of the productions placed before
us, a very marked difference in quality. Compare, for
instance, the two pictures of kangaroo on <a href="#plate47">Plate XLVII</a>. They
are the works of men of the same tribe, are all similarly drawn,
and come from the same locality. Yet, in the upper picture,
the outline and proportions of the two animals are so incorrect
that it is very doubtful whether many people not acquainted
with the locality would guess what animal the pictures are intended
to represent. In the lower picture, however, anybody
acquainted with the shape of a kangaroo would have no hesitation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
in pronouncing his diagnosis. The characteristic attitude,
the large tail, the disproportion between the front and hind
limbs, and the shape of the head are quite true enough to
nature to permit of correct identification.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure26" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure26.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 26. Carving depicting a quarrel between a man and his gin.
Arunndta tribe (× 1/2). Tracing.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The three designs are all drawn in charcoal, the figures in
the first two cases being outlined with a white pipe-clay line,
and in the second case with one of yellow ochre. If we wish
to go one better still, we need only study the pipe-clay drawing
on bark by a native of the Katherine River district shown on
<a href="#plate49">Plate XLIX</a>, 1—a very creditable picture of a dead kangaroo.</p>

<p>Some of the designs one meets with are so accurately drawn
that a scientific determination of the species becomes possible.
Look for a moment at the fish, portrayed in pipe-clay, shown
in <a href="#plate48">Plate XLVIII</a>. The piscine nature of the form, here depicted
on rocks, is not only apparent, but it is possible to say
with some certainty that the two shown swimming belong to
the <i>Toxotes</i>, which are commonly called Archer Fish. The
form shown in <a href="#plate49">Plate XLIX</a>, 4, is unquestionably meant to
be one of the <i>Therapon</i> species. Both kinds of fish are known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
to be living in the Katherine River, not far from the site at
which these pictures were drawn.</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, some of the designs are so poor
as to be barely recognizable or even quite unrecognizable by
us, how does the aboriginal manage? When the artist is
present, he can explain. But he is not always available!</p>

<p>If, by way of illustration, we were asked to say definitely
what the meaning of the central figure on <a href="#plate50">Plate L</a>, 1, was
we should in all probability want to know more about it before
committing ourselves. But an aboriginal can give us a correct
reply immediately. The locality at which the photograph was
obtained is north of the Musgrave Ranges in central Australia.
But that does not give us any clue. After studying the picture
more closely, we might be able to distinguish the outline of a
quadruped, the four legs being shown, one behind the other,
in a row, and a big head on the right-hand side, in a position
suggesting that the animal is feeding. But these are characteristics
common to many animals!</p>

<p>So far, therefore, we have seen nothing to suggest the class
of animal we are dealing with. When we look again, we
might note that there is a crude image of a human being shown
on the back of the animal; and behind this is a structure which
might stand for a saddle. We guess the answer and claim that
the group is a very poor drawing of a man on horseback.</p>

<p>But there are other animals a man could ride! And when
we look again, we observe that the second leg of the animal,
counting from the right, has a peculiar enlargement attached
to its lower end. That structure is the key to the riddle; it
represents the track of the animal! Those familiar with the
great beast of burden, now used extensively in central Australia,
will recognize the two-toed spoor of a camel.</p>

<p>This method of pictorial elucidation is by no means exceptional.
We have already noticed something similar in the
ancient carvings at Port Hedland, where the human foot-print<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
is added to disperse any doubt which may be entertained in so
far as the correct interpretation of the figure is concerned. A
similar device is well exemplified in the accompanying sketch
of an ochre drawing of a human form from the Glenelg River
district in the northern Kimberleys of Western Australia (<a href="#figure15">Fig.
15</a>). In the carving of an emu from the King Sound district,
which is reproduced in <a href="#plate42">Plate XLII</a>, 2, we noticed the same
sort of thing.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure27" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure27.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 27. Ochre-drawing of spear-boomerang duel, Arunndta tribe (× 1/2).
Tracing.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cases before us are not accidental, but we have acquainted
ourselves with the recognized determinative system of
Australian pictographs which is quite analogous to that known
to have been practised by the ancient Egyptians. Consider, for
instance, the character signifying “to love”—a human figure
in profile with one hand lifted to the level of the mouth. The
same figure, with a few parallel wavy lines, signifying water,
drawn against it, means no longer “to love,” but “to drink.”
The wavy lines in this instance are the determinative. In the
Australian illustrations given above, we have selected samples
which are easily followed, but there are many cases where the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
reading would be quite impossible if it were not for the presence
of the little, subsidiary, determinative sketch.</p>

<p>In his endeavour to make the meaning of some of his designs
clear, a native often embodies as many features as possible,
quite regardless as to whether in reality they would all be
visible in the one plane he is drawing. In the picture of a
crocodile appearing on a boabab-nut from the Derby district
in Western Australia, shown in <a href="#figure16">Fig. 16</a>, it will be observed
that the reptile, in spite of having its dorsal surface represented,
has its vent indicated. The long, slender muzzle of
this figure, by the way, makes it clear that the smaller species
of the two northern Australian crocodiles (<i>C. Johnstoni</i>) is
intended. The human figure, too, very often appears half in
full and half in profile.</p>

<p>The aboriginal is a keen observer, and takes careful note of
many things besides a kangaroo, a snake track, or other similar
natural objects which may lead him to his daily bread. When
travelling in the Buccaneer Archipelago in the far north-west
I remember one of the natives drawing my attention to a
peculiar formation in the clouds, and saying, in the Sunday
Island dialect: “<i>Arrar ninmiddi</i>,” which means, literally:
“Cloud knee.” My instructor proceeded to draw the extraordinary
shape he could see with his finger upon the hatchway
of the pearling lugger we were sailing in, after which he completed
the figure of a man. I was struck with this man’s
faculty of observation, because the cloud effect he referred to
was rather out of the common and projected from a cirro-cumulus
like the bent limb of a swastica.</p>

<p>It is in this way that many inspirations come to the cave
artist. Repeatedly one has occasion to notice how a pre-existing
feature or defect in the rock face—a crevice, a floor, a concretion—becomes
the centre piece of a design drawn to suit it.
The feature one finds most commonly embodied in a cave
drawing is a small hole. This often figures in the place of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
animal’s eye, or a hole into which a snake is disappearing. A
local bulge in the rock may also be taken in as part of a
design and represent portion of a head or body.</p>

<p>Not only does the artist embody suitable natural features in
his designs, but, conversely, he also applies his knowledge of
form to explain already existing phenomena in the world
about him. The embodiment of his artistic ideas in his poetical
explanations of Nature’s wonders plays, as might be expected,
an important role in his mythology. These remarks apply
especially to any striking characteristics in the sky. When
among the tribes of the Musgrave Ranges, I ascertained that
the black-looking gap in the Milky Way, close to the Southern
Cross, which is commonly known as the Coal Sack, was referred
to as “<i>Kaleya Pubanye</i>,” that is, the “Resting Emu.”</p>

<p>In the north of Australia, the Larrekiya, Wogait, and other
tribes have adopted a similar designation for a series of dark
spaces along the Milky Way. But they have extended the
idea considerably in that the Coal Sack represents only the head
of a gigantic emu, the beak of which is pointed towards the
<i>Musca</i> constellation (<i>i.e.</i> towards the south). A small star
of the Southern Cross group very appropriately stands for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
eye of the bird; the nebulous effect usually surrounding this
star gives it an extra life-like appearance. The neck is but
faintly discernible near the head, but becomes clearly visible in
the neighbourhood of the nearer Pointer; it passes between the
two Pointers and curves slightly towards the constellation of
<i>Lupus</i>. Within the constellation of <i>Norma</i>, the dark space
widens considerably and represents the body of the emu. The
blunt tail turns sharply towards, and into, the constellation of
<i>Scorpio</i>. A nebulous patch lying practically on the point of
junction between the imaginary areas of <i>Ara</i>, <i>Scorpio</i>, and
<i>Norma</i> affords a good division between the legs of the bird,
whilst another lying between μ and ζ of the Scorpion group
separates the tail. The lower portions of the legs are not very
clear, but some of the more imaginative natives maintain that
they can distinguish three toes on each extremity. There is
no doubt the primitive eye has herein discovered a striking
similarity between an optical phenomenon in the southern sky
and a living creature, which is of great importance in the
hunting field, and at the same time plays a prominent role in
tribal folk-lore. They refer to this emu by the name of
“<i>Dangorra</i>.” Vide <a href="#figure17">Fig. 17</a>.</p>

<p>As affording a means of comparison, a hunting scene is reproduced
carved upon the surface of a club by aborigines of
Victoria. The little group is composed of an aboriginal hunter
who in one hand is poising a spear and in the other is carrying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
a boomerang; behind him are two emus standing in much the
same position as that assumed to be the case in the heavenly
image just described.</p>

<p>The Minning at Eucla recognize only the long neck of the
emu in the sky, and refer to it as “<i>Yirrerri</i>”; on the Nullarbor
Plains the same portion is looked upon as the heavenly tjuringa
of the emu.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure30" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure30.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 30. Pictograph of lizard, natural and conventional form.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Speaking generally, there is perhaps no other creature living
which figures so frequently in aboriginal art, both on the cave
wall and in the dance, as the great struthious bird of Australia.
This is no doubt due in the first place to the admirable way
in which it lends itself for the purposes mentioned; its antics
in the field suggest many tricks for mimicry at a corrobboree,
and its distinctive form supplies the artist with a model which
never fails to attract the attention of the artistically inclined
among his people. In <a href="#plate49">Plate XLIX</a>, 2, we have a pipeclay
drawing of an emu from the Katherine River which is rather
exceptional in that it shows the bird more <i>en face</i> than is usual;
the proportions are, on the whole, good, except that the head
is screwed upwards in a rather strange way. On a boomerang
from Broome (<a href="#figure18">Fig. 18</a>), we have a series of engraved emu
pictures, all in profile, and in different attitudes.</p>

<p>On the whole, an aboriginal’s pictures are flat and without
perspective. He takes the inspiration direct from nature and
reproduces the subject singly, and as a separate entity; a number
of such designs are drawn side by side with or without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
pictographic sequence. But there are countless occasions upon
which artists, especially the more gifted, prefer to draw a real
scene from life, combining subject with action. Environment
or surroundings rarely, if ever, receive attention.</p>

<p>Take as a very simple illustration the lizard shown in the
pipeclay rock drawing from the Katherine River (<a href="#plate49">Plate
XLIX</a>, 3). The general shape of the body, together with the
large and well-differentiated head, strongly suggests a species of
the large monitor which is common throughout the district. The
interesting feature about the picture is, however, the life which
is indicated by the fact that the reptile is drawn in the act of
shooting out a long, split tongue.</p>

</figure>

<p>Again, in the charcoal sketch of two crows from the Pigeon
Hole district (<a href="#figure19">Fig. 19</a>), one bird is represented in an attentive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
attitude, as though on the point of flying away, while the other
is very characteristically shown in the act of cawing.</p>

<p>One could produce an almost endless variety of decorated
figures, representing men and women performing at ceremonial
dances and corrobborees to illustrate the life and action which
is embodied in aboriginal art. In <a href="#figure20">Fig. 20</a> a selected number
of pipe-clay drawings from the Humbert River, Northern Territory,
have been grouped together to serve this purpose.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure33" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 33. Normal, conventional, and emblematic representations of

</figure>

<p>The most interesting effects, however, are those brought
about by a combination of two or more figures. How different,
for instance, the two kangaroo shown together in <a href="#figure21">Fig. 21</a> seem
to those previously discussed (<a href="#plate47">Plate XLVII</a>). These are charcoal
drawings from Pigeon Hole on the Victoria River, and in
them the hopping movement of the animals is indicated very
clearly. The animal in the rear is in full flight, as the erect
position of the tail and the general holding of the body betray;
but the one in the lead is on the point of drawing up and is
turning its head back towards its mate.</p>

<p>How realistic, too, the little bark drawing is from east of
Port Darwin (<a href="#figure22">Fig. 22</a>), in which a bird of prey is shown
mounted upon a wallaby or kangaroo, with its claws and beak
embedded in the flesh of its victim.</p>

</figure>

<p>A neat pipe-clay drawing from the remote Humbert River<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
district is presented in <a href="#figure23">Fig. 23</a>. The group, which is three feet
in length, is composed of a central figure of a man who is
holding one arm on each side towards a dog, as if offering them
something to eat or for the purpose of patting them. The
dogs seem to be giving their attention to the man.</p>

</figure>

<p>Two more charcoal drawings from Pigeon Hole, though
roughly sketched by the artist, depict very graphically scenes
from the hunt. In one (<a href="#figure24">Fig. 24</a>), the hunter is in the act of
stalking a buffalo or bullock with his spear held in readiness
to throw, while in the other the attitude of the hunter indicates
that the spear has just been thrown and is entering the body
of the prey, a kangaroo (<a href="#figure25">Fig. 25</a>).</p>

<p>The carving of an Arunndta man, reproduced in <a href="#figure26">Fig. 26</a>,
is most effective. An angry husband has been caught by the
artist in the act of punishing his wife with a waddy. The
placement of the legs of the two persons indicates stability on
the part of the man engaged in the flagellation, and a swinging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
movement on the part of the woman who is being held back
by her hand.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure35" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure35.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 35. A dog-track.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We have already seen the carved representations of two
stages in a stone-knife duel by an Arunndta tribesman (<a href="#figure04">Fig.
4</a>), and here, in <a href="#figure27">Fig. 27</a>, an ochre drawing is reproduced
which is, if anything, more animated than any previously discussed.
A spear-boomerang duel is being fought, during which
each of the combatants is protecting himself with a shield.
The artist has evinced considerable talent in portraying the
men just at the moment when both are bounding through the
air towards each other, the one on the left parrying his opponent’s
spear, while the other, on the right, is preparing to
receive the blow from the boomerang.</p>

</figure>

<p>One might now go a step further in analyzing aboriginal art.
The productions we have studied so far embody the ideas of
form, life, and action; and, it might be added, occasionally one
finds a very fair sense of composition as well. Such, indeed,
might already be said to be true of several of the pictures
discussed above, but a finer specimen lies before us in the
charcoal drawing from Pigeon Hole (<a href="#figure28">Fig. 28</a>). This faithfully
portrays a scene from a gala ceremony, in which the body
of performers, fully “dressed” for the occasion, are acting before
the leader, who, in his turn, is being supported by two others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
in the foreground. It must be admitted that the composition
of this group of figures is remarkably good, and, what is quite
exceptional, a very successful attempt has been made at perspective.
All figures are shown in different attitudes of dancing.
The impression this charcoal drawing gives one, at first glance,
is that of a rough sketch in crayon resembling the outline a
European artist might make on his canvas prior to starting
upon the actual painting.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure37" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure37.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 37. A rabbit track.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Leaving that section of aboriginal art which deals essentially
with designs copied directly from Nature in a sense more or
less purely artistic and æsthetic, we shall turn our attention
to a few types which are more specialized.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure38" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure38.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 38. Emu tracks.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From a study of his religious ideas, we have learned that the
aboriginal identifies himself with some mystic, natural creature
or object, which he adopts as his “totem.” It would only be
reasonable to expect, therefore, that some of the drawings represent
these objects; and that they are recognized by the
natives as having particular personal or family significance.
Looked at from a modern standpoint, these designs are really
the equivalent of a family crest, and are claimed only by those
rightfully entitled to them. This explanation must be given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
for many of the naturalistic designs appearing on rocks, trees,
grave posts, and personal belongings. These “totemic” crests
or symbols being hereditary, we have before us a primitive
form of heraldry, a conception we have already learned to be
covered by the word “<i>Kobong</i>,” originally introduced by Sir
George Grey from the north-west of Australia.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure39" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure39.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 39. Pictographic representation of nesting emu.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure40" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure40.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 40. A lizard track.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We have also ascertained that some of the central as well as
north-western tribes of Australia believe that the earliest tribal
ancestors originally were more animal than human in appearance,
and adopted the shape of a man only at a later period;
that they can, however, return to the animal form whenever
they desire; and that others remain semi-human. It is not
surprising, therefore, to find amongst their drawings and
carvings representations which are partly human and partly
animal in outline; these are honest attempts at perpetuating
the traditional appearance of the ancestral beings of the tribe.
In the photograph attached hereto (<a href="#plate51">Plate LI</a>, 1), taken at
Forrest River, two pictures of such creatures are to be found
which are drawn in ochre. There were many others, from three
to five feet in length, reptilian in shape, some with human hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
and feet, others with hair shown upon the head, and in most
of them the sex unduly prominent. These remarkable designs
are, therefore, not naturalistic, but have been evolved on purely
fictional or mythological lines, based upon the tradition of the
tribe and upon the imagination of the artist.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure41" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure41.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 41. A snake or snake-track.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From the consideration of these artistic effigies of their
Demigods, it is not a big step forwards which brings us face
to face with the sacred tribal drawings. During initiation
ceremonies, especially of the now practically extinct south-eastern
tribes of Australia, gigantic figures resembling a human
being were moulded into the surface of the ground and subsequently
tinted with ochre, which were supposed to conceal
the Great Spirit or Deity, which, like the “<i>Altjerra Knaninja</i>”
of central Australia, watched over the proceedings as the young
men passed from a condition of adolescence to that of permanent
manhood; numerous carvings and ochre drawings were
also made upon the trunks of any trees nearby.</p>

<p>Not only during the initiation ceremonies are these practices
resorted to, but when a sacred observance is contemplated,
especially those having to do with the “totem,” elaborate designs
are painted in ochre upon the surrounding surfaces of rocks and
trees which depict an act connected with the traditional origin
of the sacred object.</p>

<p>A classical illustration is to be found in the MacDonnell
Ranges, at Emily Gap. According to Arunndta belief, it was
at this spot that the early semi-human ancestors of the witchedy
grub or “<i>Utnguringita</i>” alighted from Altjerringa. They
brought with them large numbers of the grub, which they
cooked and ate. The territory dominated by these ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
beings extended from Heavitree Gap to Emily Gap, and across
to Jessie Gap. On the western wall of the first-named gap,
known by the natives as “<i>Ndariba</i>,” an inclined slab of rock,
not high above the level of the sandy bed of the Todd River,
contains a series of peculiar concentric iron stains which are
regarded as the impressions of the stern of an Utnguringita
Altjerra who sat there, and, as he collected grubs, moved forwards.
The Utnguringita came into frequent conflict with
the Dingo or “Knullia” people whose country lay immediately
west of Heavitree Gap, but, nevertheless, they blessed the land
with many eggs, which developed into larvæ and supplied the
tribe with food.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure42" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure42.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 42. Human foot-prints and trail.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Eventually the Utnguringita ancestors returned to Altjerringa,
but they left a number of stone tjuringas in Emily Gap,
which are supposed to be occupied by the spirits whenever a
sacred ceremony is performed on the spot. On the eastern
stony wall of this gap some rather imposing designs are to be
seen, which originally must have occupied most of the area
available. The drawings are very old; their origin dating back
long before the recollections of the present generation. It is wonderful
how well the work has withstood the denuding action
of the weather for so long. The natives tell you that the old
Altjerringa men applied the pigment to the rock and that they
mixed it with the “<i>knudda</i>” (fat) of the grubs. It is more
likely that the ochres were mixed with emu fat; in places the
pigment seems as though it were chemically combined with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
rock, and it could only be removed by chipping the surface.
The designs in their present condition (<a href="#plate51">Plate LI</a>, 2) consist of
a series of parallel, vertical lines, alternately coloured red and
white, and capped by horizontal bands of the same colours, the
white of which containing three or four red dots. What the
original designs may have been like, it is now difficult to say,
but the natives maintain that they included the images of some
women they call “<i>Aluggurra</i>,” who were waiting at the foot
of the cliff while the men were concealing their tjuringas in
the rocks and nooks above. To the present day, the old men
of the local Arunndta group store their ceremonial objects in
the same sanctuary, thinking that the sacred figures on the
wall will protect them from the hands of inquisitive intruders.</p>

<p>There remains yet another class of ochre drawing which deserves
mention. I allude to the famous discovery of Sir George
Grey in 1837. There is perhaps no other Australian drawing,
old or modern, which has been so freely discussed and criticized.
During an expedition in the northern Kimberleys of Western
Australia, it was my good fortune to re-discover several
drawings of this type in practically the same locality as that
recorded by Sir George Grey, near the Glenelg River. One
figure was perfect, others were partly obliterated or incomplete.
The best design was in a cave near the top of a prominent
bluff the local Worora people call Berrial; it was drawn
in ochre upon a steep face of rock immediately under an overhanging
ledge of quartzite. The figure was unquestionably
that of a human being, although it measured fully nine feet in
length. It lay fully extended, upon its left side, with its arms
placed straight against its sides. It reminded one forcibly of a
Buddha in a Ceylonese temple. What made the figure seem
un-Australian was that it was clothed in a long, striped garment,
resembling a priestly gown, from which only the head,
hands, and feet were excluded. A loosely-fitting belt is also
shown. As seems common to all these drawings, the facial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
features are only indicated by the eyes and nose, the mouth
being omitted. Another characteristic, which is shared by all
other drawings, is that the head is surrounded by a number of
peculiar, concentric bands, through which, and from which,
many lines radiate, giving the structure the effect of a halo
surrounding the head of a saint. The picture bore an unmistakable
likeness to the type illustrated by Sir George Grey,
and was drawn in red, brown, black, and white. Vide <a href="#figure29">Fig. 29</a>
and <a href="#plate50">Plate L</a>, 2.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 43. “A man is tracking a rabbit.” Simple example of pictography.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is no doubt about these curious drawings, now more
or less adopted by the local tribe, having originated under some
exotic influence. It is historically known that for centuries
past excursions have been made to the north of Australia by
Macassans and other eastern people, who may have been responsible
for the first drawing of a figure of so sacerdotal an
appearance, which the aborigines have since learned to copy so
perfectly. It has also been speculated that shipwrecked sailors
might be responsible for the representation of the clothed human
form; in fact, an American scientist, John Campbell, claims to
have deciphered an ancient Japanese inscription upon one of
Grey’s figures referring to the “hopeless number,” presumably
of the castaways.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 44. Pictographic representation of emu-hunt.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In regard to the quaint head-gear which distinguishes these
designs, one need not go far from Australia to find something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
quite analogous, for the Papuans wear an article which is quite
similar to what might be suggested by the drawings.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure45" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure45.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 45. Flying fox pattern.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We now turn to a more psychological aspect of primitive
Australian art, which includes such factors as convention and
imagination. These processes lie behind the symbolization of
thought which has evolved a means of pictographically conveying
messages from one individual to another, or, collectively,
from one tribe to another. Through long usage, the artist has
learned to reduce the complexity of a familiar, naturalistic
design in such a way that, while still retaining its intrinsic
interpretation, he is able to demonstrate by a few lines what
ordinarily would require an intricate drawing. The ultimate
aim of such a system is, of course, to reduce the execution of a
design to a minimum of energy and time, without imperilling
the correctness of its interpretation. But whilst the artist is
designing to simplify the complexity of his thought symbol, the
reciprocative factor of assimilation on the part of his fellows
is being stimulated. And by means of this joint education, a
design, with a simple motive from Nature behind it, might
gradually become so conventionalized that the uninitiated fails
entirely to grasp its significance.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp42" id="plate44" style="max-width: 25em;">

<p>1. Hand marks in cave, Port George IV, Worora tribe.</p>

<p>2. Foot marks in cave, Port George IV, Worora tribe.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>During this evolution, or, should one say, metamorphosis,
in the perception of art, the tendency must necessarily be to
smooth out the irregular and unsymmetrical contours of Nature
and bring the design down to as nearly geometrical as possible.
For the same reason, a single design is often repeated indefinitely,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
so that a single form derived from a simple motive may
expand into a continuous chain or ornate pattern covering a
considerable area. A large series of devices has been established,
the majority of which are known all over the Australian continent;
but, as the same time, there are many signs which are
entirely of a “totemic” nature and can only be understood by
a person belonging to that particular “totem.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure46" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure46.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 46. Conventional representation of hopping kangaroo.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let us take a few simple cases illustrating the different points
enumerated above.</p>

<p>A simple drawing of a lizard would include a substantial
body, with rounded head and tapering tail; the legs are usually
extended, and at times have the claws marked. Vide <a href="#figure30">Fig. 30</a>.</p>

<p>The conventionalized form consists of a long straight line
crossed at right angles by two shorter bars, at points about one-quarter
and three-quarters distance respectively from one end.</p>

<p>A turtle design consists of an oval, representing the shield,
from which extend the head, tail, and paddles. In its modified
form this becomes a circle with six short lines radiating from
the circumference at equal distances apart (<a href="#figure31">Fig. 31</a>).</p>

<p>The picture of a frog in its simplified form becomes, like that
of a turtle, a circle, but has only four radiating lines (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>).
When designs like these are expanded symmetrically into patterns,
the result is after the style of that shown in the accompanying
sketches. These patterns are extensively used in
totemic devices upon tjuringas and implements.</p>

<p>The drawing of an echidna, or native hedgehog, ordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
is like the sketch shown above (<a href="#figure33">Fig. 33</a>), but as a result of its
conventional transformation it becomes a simple hexagon, from
the corners of which the limbs may or may not be shown as
simply projecting lines. The pattern obtained by linking up
a number of hexagons is not uncommonly found engraved upon
weapons and implements.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 47. Crossed boomerangs, the symbolic representation of a fight.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Many of the conventional patterns are not so apparent as
the few just mentioned. Let us take, for instance, the “<i>Ladjia</i>”
or Yam Tjuringa pattern of the Arunndta. Only the initiated
would be able to recognize in a number of groups of small,
concentric circles, regularly placed at the corners of rectangular
figures, as the stems of the yam plant, and a system of parallel
lines connecting the circles both straight and diagonally as
the roots. Vide <a href="#figure34">Fig. 34</a>.</p>

<p>Tracks of animal, bird, and man are conspicuous among the
designs, generally, whether they be true copies from Nature
upon the walls of a cave, more or less modified gravures upon
weapons, or conventional patterns incised upon a message stick.
A dog track is represented by a larger dot, suggesting the imprint
of the ball of the paw, to which are attached four smaller
dots, which lie in a row in close proximity to the former; the
smaller dots stand for the impressions of the claws (<a href="#figure35">Fig. 35</a>).</p>

<p>A kangaroo track shows the two long parallel median impressions,
with a lateral at an acute angle to the former at
either side. The same figure is repeated a short distance away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
from the one described, and in a straight line with it. The
same design on a smaller scale denotes a wallaby track. Occasionally
the lateral lines are dispensed with (<a href="#figure36">Fig. 36</a>).</p>

<p>Small oblong dots drawn in pair at equal distances from each
other indicate the hopping of a rabbit (<a href="#figure37">Fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p>The characteristic broad arrow-like footprint of an emu has
already been referred to; the smaller variety of the same design
implies that a wild turkey is meant. When a number of birds
are to be represented collectively, the archetype is developed
into a continuous pattern by linking one track up with another
into a chain (<a href="#figure38">Fig. 38</a>).</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure48" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 48. Witchedy grub Tjuringa, Arunndta tribe (× 3/10). Tracing.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When attention is to be drawn to the fact that the birds
are laying, or sitting on eggs, a number of small circles are
drawn about the track (<a href="#figure39">Fig. 39</a>).</p>

<p>A lizard track is indicated by drawing a number of dots,
equally spaced along a straight line, and on alternate sides of
it. The dots are the claw impressions, the line the trail left
by the tail (<a href="#figure40">Fig. 40</a>).</p>

<p>A single wavy line, or a number of parallel wavy lines, represents
a snake or a snake track (<a href="#figure41">Fig. 41</a>).</p>

<p>The human footprint is either correctly shown in detail, or
is reduced to a short, straight line at one end of which five
(occasionally only three or four) dots are drawn in a sloping
line to indicate the toes. When walking is to be implied, these
footprints are either shown one behind the other in a straight
line, at equal distances apart, or they stand alternately right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
and left by an imaginary central line. The common way of
showing the last-named system conventionally is to connect the
alternate footprints, whether they be actually shown or not,
by a zig-zag line (<a href="#figure42">Fig. 42</a>).</p>

<p>In all cases mentioned above, the track may stand equally
well for the object itself.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure49" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 49. Symbolic pictograph of kangaroo Tjuringa, Arunndta tribe.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It is a common thing to see two or more of the above systems
combined, after the style of the figures shown on <a href="#Page_344">page 344</a>.</p>

<p>The interpretation of the first of these messages would be:
“A man is tracking a rabbit.”</p>

<p>The second (<a href="#figure44">Fig. 44</a>) would read: “A hunter is pursuing
an emu and is accompanied by his dog.”</p>

<p>In the same way as the natives of the Northern Territory
have applied their artistic talents to deciphering images of
earthly objects amongst the celestial bodies, and point with
pride upon the great emu, “<i>Dangorra</i>,” which nightly watches
over them, so the Wongapitcha and Aluridja of central Australia
recognize in the constellation we know as the Southern
Cross the shape of an eagle-hawk’s claw, and call it in consequence
“<i>Warridajinna</i>”; the Milky Way they consider to be
a creek bed and assign to it the name “<i>Karru</i>”; the northern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
Kimberleys tribes believe the Milky Way to be the track of a
great carpet snake they refer to as “<i>Womma</i>.”</p>

<p>In the representation of a fish, the scales often take the form
of a cross-hatched pattern; but there are many cases in which
the form of the fish is not shown at all, yet the cross-hatched
pattern remains and is nevertheless indicative of the fish.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure50" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure50.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 50. Symbolic pictograph of caterpillar, Tjuringa, Arunndta tribe.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A design, fairly common in the north of Western Australia,
consists of two wavy lines which are parallel, in the inverted
or reflected sense, and joined at one end. The true significance
of this pattern does not become evident until one hides from
view all but three of the “waves,” say that portion lying to
the right of the dotted line in the accompanying sketch. When
this is done, the form of a “flying fox” is immediately recognized
(<a href="#figure45">Fig. 45</a>).</p>

<p>In central, northern, and eastern Australia, a pattern frequently
met with on boomerangs, fighting sticks, and message
sticks, consists of strings of lenticles longitudinally striped and
generally associated with kangaroo tracks. This device is
analogous to the one standing for the walking of a man, viz.
the zig-zag, in so far as it stands for the hopping of a kangaroo.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
Here and there one finds the pattern “finished off” at one end
with the head of a kangaroo (<a href="#figure46">Fig. 46</a>).</p>

<p>A duel or tribal fight of any description is graphically recorded
by two crossed boomerangs, but the conventional derivative
of this design is simply supplied by two crossed lines
(<a href="#figure47">Fig. 47</a>).</p>

<p>Time is chronicled by two phases of the moon; a crescent
standing for new, and a circle for full moon.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="figure51" style="max-width: 31.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 51. Symbolic drawing of “native-pear totem,” Arunndta tribe.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The substance, origin, home, or habitat of any creature
figuring in a drawing or gravure is particularized by the addition
of a circle-within-circle design. For instance, in the
tjuringa of the witchedy grub shown in <a href="#figure48">Fig. 48</a>, the parallel,
straight lines, enclosed within a “U,” at the left-hand side, represent
the grub, the three concentric circle groups in the
centre are the gum trees in which it lives, the “U within U”
pattern at the right is an ancestor whose “totem” was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
witchedy grub, while the parallel lines at the extreme right of
the tjuringa are markings on the grub which have been adopted
by the man who owns the tjuringa, in the form of cicatrices,
he cuts on his chest.</p>

<p>The “U within U” pattern is frequently met with engraved
upon tjuringas, and in most cases it conventionally conveys the
idea of a “sitting” person or animal. We have already noted
something similar in the peculiar concentric iron stains of
Heavitree Gap (<a href="#Page_342">page 342</a>), but in the following three tjuringa
drawings of the Arunndta additional illustrations are given.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure52" style="max-width: 25em;">

River (× 1/10).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the first instance, an “<i>Arrera Knaninja</i>” or Kangaroo
Tjuringa, the meat and the fat of the animal are represented
by the two series of concentric circles in the centre, whereas
its sinew is indicated by the horizontal lines connecting the
circles. The numerous U groups on both sides of the central
figures stand for a great number of kangaroo, each of which is
sitting or lying on the ground (<a href="#figure49">Fig. 49</a>).</p>

</figure>

<p>The second example is from the “<i>Yeapatja</i>” or Caterpillar
Tjuringa. The large “circle-within-circle” groups in the centre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
are generally recognized to be the bushes upon which the
caterpillars were born, while the U groups with smaller concentric
circles in their centres are intended for caterpillars
attached to smaller plants upon which they are feeding (<a href="#figure50">Fig.
50</a>).</p>

</figure>

<p>Lastly, a sacred drawing of the “<i>Alangua Knaninja</i>” or
Native Pear (<i>Marsdenia</i>) “totem,” which belongs to the Altjerringa
women, is composed of a central “circle-within-circle”
group representing the “totem,” whilst surrounding it a number
of U groups are supposed to be the mythic women seated on
the ground (<a href="#figure51">Fig. 51</a>).</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 54. Camps consisting of a man and his wife (left) and of eight

</figure>

<p>We shall now turn our attention to the consideration of
the representation of the human figure and its derivative forms.
Several more or less obvious designs have already been discussed.
The first step towards conventionalism is seen in the two
figures from the Humbert River district, the first an ochre cave
drawing, the second a carving on a boabab tree (<a href="#figure52">Fig. 52</a>). We
notice in the ochre drawing, which was one foot six inches
high, a fairly shapely and solid figure of a man holding a shield<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
in his left hand; in the carving, which measured one foot nine
inches in height, the solid and shapely outline has been reduced
to a matter of just a few straight lines; that is, if we neglect
for the present the consideration of shield and boomerang
which the figure is holding. The result is, therefore, a design
resembling a Latin cross, at the lower end of which is attached
an inverted V-shaped symbol representing the legs; a small
circle may or may not be added to the top end to stand for
the head.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp32" id="figure55" style="max-width: 18.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure55.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 55. Anthropomorphous designs, carved on spear-throwers. Tracing.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This design is often repeated indefinitely in a lateral sense,
so that a rather ornate pattern results in which the individual
figures “join hands” and their “toes touch” below. A chained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
pattern, such as is shown in the accompanying sketch (<a href="#figure53">Fig. 53</a>),
may be noticed in <a href="#plate45">Plate XLV</a>, 1, near the centre of the picture,
below the ledge on which the bold drawing of a snake appears,
and on the same level as the semi-human design on the extreme
left.</p>

<p>The ultimate stage of this conventionalism so far as the
human figure is concerned is a simple, straight line, the upright
arm of the cross; this is extensively employed in carved representations
of people on message sticks. We might now hark
back to the question at the beginning of our disquisition on
aboriginal art “what lies in a mere line” and supply one answer
at any rate.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure56" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure56.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Fig. 56. Anthropomorphous design, carved on pearl-shell, Sunday
Island. Tracing (× 1/4).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Any number of people might be represented by the same
number of short, straight, vertical lines. Followed by a zig-zag
line, such people are represented as being on the march. When
a small dot stands on each side of the straight line, or perhaps
a number of dots in intermediate positions between the lines,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
the design conveys the idea that the people are camped, the
dots standing for camp fires. Moreover, when a horizontal
line lies over the upright lines, the last-named indicates that a
hut, shelter, or breakwind was used during the encampment
(<a href="#figure54">Fig. 54</a>).</p>

<p>When there is an obvious, and intended, difference in the
lengths of the upright lines, the longer represent men, the
shorter women.</p>

<p>Reverting now to the cross, and looking more closely into
its development, expansion, and embodiment in anthropomorphous
designs, we meet with one or two points of considerable
interest.</p>

<p>We have had occasion to note that throughout central and
northern Australia, the tribes during the final acts of initiation
ceremonies make use of a sacred cross, called “<i>Wanningi</i>” or
“<i>Wanninga</i>” in the former region and “<i>Parli</i>” in the western
portions of the latter. These wanningi are constructed only
immediately before they are required and are destroyed again
the moment the ceremony is over. Women are not allowed
to see them under any consideration. A wanningi is made by
fixing two pieces of wood together in the shape of a cross, then,
by starting at the intersection of the arms, a long string, made
of human hair, is wound spirally round and round, from arm
to arm, until the whole space between the arms is filled in.
The size of these crosses varies from three or four inches up
to two feet or more. This object is produced by the Aluridja
just before the mutilation of the neophyte is to take place. At
this critical moment of the youth’s life, when he is stepping
from adolescence across the great gap which will lead him to
manhood, the spirit of the Great Tukura presides invisibly
concealed within the wanningi, but returns to his high abode
again when the function is over. Vide <a href="#plate43">Plate XLIII</a>, 2.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="plate46" style="max-width: 25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/plate46.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><i>PLATE XLVI</i></p>

<p>Wordaman native with his body and head decorated

Northern Territory.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The spiral winding of hair-string around the arms of the
wanningi associates the idea of the rhombic outline of the string<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
with the arms of the cross. In the representation of the human
form, one often finds the two patterns combined, or, it may be,
the rhomb replaces the cross.</p>

<p>In the example before us (<a href="#figure55">Fig. 55</a>, a), we have an engraved
pattern appearing on a spear-thrower, the motive of which,
were it not that the artist had added a human face, would have
been very difficult for the untrained eye to recognize. As it is,
we have the unmistakable evidence of an anthropomorphous
design. Not only does a modified rhomb represent the body
of a man, but the figure itself is flourishing the crossed arms
of a “<i>Wanningi</i>” in its right hand. The principal design thus
identified passes, at the bottom, into a pattern composed of
several polygonal figures which may, no doubt, be looked upon
as derivatives of an original rhomb.</p>

<p>In the other illustration (<a href="#figure55">Fig. 55</a>, b), which is also a
carving upon a spear-thrower, the intricate association of the
rhomb with the human form is again apparent. The figure of
a man, with face in profile, is represented in a plain and more
or less conventional way; the straight trunk with the two arms
resting upon the hips, symmetrically on each side, in itself
suggests the rhomb, but, in addition, most of the intervening
spaces have been filled in with parallel lines and a cross-hatching
pattern which embodies the rhomb.</p>

<p>Conventionalism in the representation of the human figure
has thus gone further than the mere inclusion of the cross or
the rhomb motive, by working in with the original design a
derivative or new pattern which fills up all the surrounding
spaces.</p>

<p>By means of this system, a new element is introduced in
the shape of symmetry. If a vertical line, drawn through the
centre of the trunk, be taken as a median line in a simple design
of the human figure, all subsequent patterns which are drawn
will be grouped symmetrically about it. The most popular pattern
used to fill up the available spaces with, is one of a “concentric”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
type. By this method a distinctive, bi-laterally symmetrical
pattern is evolved, which after prolonged usage may
actually take the place of the original, and have a true anthropomorphous
significance.</p>

<p>Take the illustration of conventionalism of this kind shown
on the carved pearl shell covering from King Sound reproduced
in <a href="#figure56">Fig. 56</a>. The original motive was a simple line drawing of
a human being after the style of the one on the left-hand side.
The next stage in its evolution was brought about by blocking
the areas between the limbs, and between the head and arm,
on either side, respectively, in a manner which made the resulting
pattern appear equally balanced in respect of a median
longitudinal line running through the back and head of the
original figure.</p>

<p>Very numerous designs of this nature are constantly met
with in all tribal areas of Australia, but in most cases the
stranger who is not aware of the intermediate or transitional
stages may fail entirely to grasp their meaning or origin.</p>

</div>

<p>There are not many places left in the world where the man
of the Stone Age can still be seen roaming the wilds of his
inherited possessions. Even in Australia, although there remain
one or two areas where comparatively little havoc has been
wrought among the primitive institutions of the indigenous
man, yet the influence of civilization is slowly, but very surely,
encroaching indirectly upon his ancient cults by such means as
inter-tribal barter, if not actually by the hand of the white
intruder. Especially do these remarks apply to the manufacture
and utilization of stone implements; it is, of course, only to
be expected that the superiority of the metal blades of the white
man’s implements would appeal to the native who formerly
had to spend hours making a crude cutting edge which only
too often broke when applied to the test for the first time. We
shall, however, treat the subject regardless of the alterations
which have been brought about by our appearance upon the
scene, and without attempting to draw up a hard and fast
scheme of classification.</p>

<p>At the present time, whilst there are not only some of the
primitive men alive still, but also a limited number of observers
who have had the good fortune of seeing them at work, it is
of vastly greater importance to record the living facts than to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
write exhaustively, nay, even speculatively, upon the comparative
shapes and embodied techniques of artefacts whose stony
composition will ensure their keeping, even fossilized, long after
the men who made them, and the scientists who lived among
them, have passed into oblivion.</p>

<p>The Australian aboriginal makes adequate use of any suitably
shaped pieces of stone he happens to find whilst in pursuit of
game; both in the Musgrave Ranges and the northern Kimberleys
stones are used in their natural shape for hurling into a
flying flock of birds, for shying at a bounding wallaby, for
bringing down nuts of the boabab, and for precipitating fledgelings
out of a nest.</p>

<p>Other stones, usually oblong and rounded pebbles gathered
in a river bed, are used for pounding and cracking purposes.
At any camping ground these pebbles can be picked up in great
numbers, showing one or two places, usually the points, at
which the percussions have worn the stone away; pounding
stones and hammers of this description are equally plentiful in
the sandhills on the plains of Adelaide, all over central Australia,
and along the north coast. They are used for pounding
seeds and foliage (the latter of which is to serve for corrobboree
decorations), for pulverizing ochre, for cracking nuts and hollow
bones containing marrow. Vide <a href="#plate54">Plate LIV</a>, 1.</p>

<p>The underlying surface consists either of a level portion of
an outcrop or another, but larger, stone, which takes the place
of an anvil. Some of the coastal tribes of eastern Australia
used to shape their heavier pounding stones by chipping away
material at one side until a stout, cylindrical handle was formed,
the whole resembling a pestle; dumb-bell shaped pounders were
also made, but were rare.</p>

<p>We have already learnt that natural pebbles or rock fragments
are also used, together with a wooden rod, for knocking
out teeth during initiation ceremonies.</p>

</figure>

<p>When cooking game, many tribes, both in central and
northern Australia, select a number of large, irregular slabs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
which they place into a shallow hole they burn a fire in. After
the oven stones have been thoroughly heated, the fire is removed
and the meat cooked on the hot stones. The Worora
at times cut the carcase open and place a number of heated
pebbles inside.</p>

<p>River-worn pebbles, measuring four or five inches in diameter,
are also extensively used by all central tribes, such as the
Dieri, Aluridja, Wongkanguru, Ngameni, Arunndta, Wongapitcha,
and Kukata, in conjunction with a large flat slab, as a
hand-mill. The slabs or nether stones, which are generally
known as “nardoo stones,” are longish-oval in shape, and up to
two feet in length.</p>

<p>The Wongapitcha use slabs of no particular shape, which
they call “<i>tchewa</i>.” The upper surface is flat or concavely
worn through constant use. It is the gin’s lot to work the
mill. She kneels in front of the slab, with its longer axis
pointing towards her, and places some of the seed she wants to
grind upon it; then she starts working the pebble forwards and
backwards with her hands, rocking it gently in the same direction
as she does so. When ground to a sufficient degree of
fineness, the flour is scraped by hand into a bark food-carrier,
and more seed placed upon the slab. On account of the rocking
motion, the hand-piece, which the Wongapitcha call “<i>miri</i>,”
eventually acquires a bevelled or convex grinding surface. Fine-grained
sandstones or quartzites are most commonly found in
use, but occasionally diorites and other igneous rocks might be
favoured. The women usually carry the hand-stone around
with them when on the march, but the basal slabs are kept at
the regular camping places.</p>

<p>Along the Darling River, and in the west-central districts
of New South Wales, the nether stones consist of large sandstone
pebbles, in the two less convex surfaces of which perfectly
circular and convex husking holes have been made in consequence
of the daily use they are put to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<p>Haphazard rock fragments, usually of sandstone, with at
least one broken surface, are extensively made use of for rasping
and smoothing down the sides and edges of boomerangs, and
of other wooden articles during the course of their construction.</p>

<p>Any suitable, flattish-oblong pebbles of hard quartzite, diorite,
dolerite, and other igneous rock of homogeneous and finely
crystalline texture, which have been symmetrically worn by the
weather, are collected by the natives during their excursions
and subsequently worked up into hatchet heads. This is done
by obliquely chipping or grinding that of the smaller sides
which is considered the more suitable, on one or both faces,
until a straight or convex cutting edge results. The chipping
is done with another fragment of hard rock, the grinding
against an outcrop or slab of sufficiently hard stone which happens
to be handy. The shape of the pebble is in most cases
improved by chipping it before the cutting edge is ground,
according to whether it is going to be ovate, triangular, or
elongate-oblong when completed. Some patterns, such as those
of Victoria, New South Wales, and the eastern-central region
of South Australia (Strzelecki Creek), have a transverse groove
cut right around the piece, at about two-thirds the whole length
from the cutting edge, which is designed to hold the wooden
haft when the implement is in use.</p>

<p>In many of the tribal districts igneous rocks do not occur
naturally, but they are nevertheless obtained by barter from
adjoining friendly tribes. The Dieri, Wongkanguru, Ngameni,
and other Cooper Creek tribes obtain all their stone axe heads
from New South Wales; the south-eastern tribes of South Australia
used to receive their supplies from the hills tribes of
what is now Victoria; and the Aluridja, Kuyanni, Arrabonna,
and Kukata were regularly supplied from the MacDonnell
Ranges and from Queensland through Arunndta agency. The
fortunate tribes who owned outcrops of suitable stone carried
on a regular trade with the surrounding districts and opened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
up quarries to meet the demand. The supplies were, however,
not tribe-owned, but usually the property of a limited number
of men who came to them by hereditary influence. Similar
conditions are met with on the north coast; Sunday Island,
consisting essentially of coarse-grained granitic rock, the natives
have to import most of the material they use for making their
stone implements from the mainland opposite; in consequence,
they are loth to part with their weapons.</p>

<p>The stone axe head is fixed to a wooden handle after the
following fashion. A long, flat piece of split wood or wiry
bark is bent upon itself and tied together at its ends. The
stone is thickly covered at its blunt end with hot porcupine
grass resin and inserted into the loop of the haft, which is firmly
pressed into the resin against the stone and tied together with
human hair-string as near to the stone as possible. The free
ends of the handle are then also tied together; after which the
resin is worked with the fingers to fill up any gaps which may
remain between the handle and the stone. The handle, and
often the axe head as well, is decorated with punctate and
banded ochre designs.</p>

<p>The size of the stone axes varies considerably; as two extremes,
a large Arunndta specimen from the Finke River
measures nearly eight and a half inches in length, by three in
breadth, and weighs three and three-quarter pounds, whilst one
from King Sound, in the north of Western Australia, measures
three and a half inches by two and a half, and weighs only six
ounces, the handle of the latter being only six and three-quarter
inches long.</p>

<p>The flakes and splinters which fly from the pebble during
the making of an axe head are not all discarded as useless by
the native; among them he often finds one or two pieces which
have a strong sharp edge with a butt opposite, suitable for
holding between two or more fingers. Flakes of this type make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
useful scrapers with which he can work the surfaces of his
wooden weapons and implements.</p>

<p>The same flaking and chipping process is purposely applied
to rocks of a particularly hard and brittle nature, such as a
fine-grained, porcelainized quartzite or chert, to obtain flakes
for cutting, scraping, and holing purposes. Many of the best
operating “knives,” with which initiation mutilations are performed,
are derived in this simple way; as might be imagined,
some of these implements are as sharp as a razor.</p>

<p>One frequently finds a fair-sized block of suitable stone
among the paraphernalia of a native in camp, from which he
chips pieces as he requires them. These blocks have been termed
“cores” or “nuclei”; they are six inches or more cube in the
beginning, but by the time a goodly number of flakes have been
removed, the parent piece becomes much smaller and gradually
assumes the shape of a truncated cone whose surface shows
many faces from which flakes have been knocked off.</p>

<p>When deciding upon a place for removing a flake, a native
always selects a corner, in order that the detached piece might
be triangular in transverse section, and, therefore, without exception,
lanceolate in shape. Thus the simple flakes are obtained
which make stone knives and spear heads. To serve as
a knife, the flake is fitted with a handle in one the following
ways. It may be attached by means of porcupine grass resin
in the bend of a folded haft of wood, as described of the axe
above, or its thick end may be held in a cleft, made at the top
of a stick, and secured by a good quantity of resin. The simplest
form, however, is one common throughout the central and
northern regions; it consists of a blade of quartzite embedded
at its blunt end in a round mass of resin. The largest stone
knives come from the tribes immediately north of the MacDonnell
Ranges. The Kaitidji make quartzite blades up to seven
inches long and two and a half inches wide, which they embed
in a ball of resin and attach to the top of a short, thin, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
flat slab of wood. The blades of these knives are protected by
keeping them in sheaths of bark when not in use.</p>

</figure>

<p>The coastal tribes of the Northern Territory, such as the
Wogait, Mulluk-Mulluk, Ponga-Ponga, and Sherait, break
similar flakes of quartzite from a core, which they insert into
the split end of a reed spear and make secure with a mass of
resin or wild bees’ wax.</p>

<p>A narrow, oblong fragment, with the two long edges bevelled
on the same surface, such as would be obtained by removing
two flakes from the same spot, and keeping the lower, finds
considerable application in the sense of a spokeshave. The implement
is specially prized when it is slightly curved. Much of
the trimming, smoothing, and rounding of wooden surfaces is
accomplished with this tool. The native sits with his legs
straight in front of him and holds the object he is shaping (like
for instance the boomerang shown in <a href="#plate55">Plate LV</a>, 2) tightly between
his heels. He seizes the stone flake with the fingers of
both hands, leaving a clear space of about an inch in the centre,
and laying the cutting edge against the wood, pushes it forwards
at an angle. This process planes down the surface very effectively,
and the ground soon becomes covered with the thin
shavings produced.</p>

<p>In former days the River Murray and south-eastern tribes
used pointed splinters of stone for making holes through the
skins of animals they made up into rugs. Nowadays the
northern tribes make awls out of bones which they sharpen at
one end; they are used principally for holing the edges of their
bark implements prior to stitching them together with strips
of cane.</p>

<p>By additional chipping, the main flake, whether obtained from
a nucleus or otherwise, is often altered considerably in appearance,
without necessarily improving its effectiveness as an implement
or its deadliness as a weapon.</p>

<p>The south-eastern natives, as, for instance, those of the Victorian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
Lakes district, as well as those of central Australia,
used to select a flat fragment of hard rock, into one straight
side of which they chipped a shallow concavity; this instrument
answered the purpose of a rasp when finishing off such articles
as spears, waddies, and clubs which had cylindrical, convex, or
curved contours to bring into shape.</p>

<p>The old Adelaide plains tribe were in possession of scrapers
which they constructed out of thin slabs of clay-slate. The
implement was more or less semi-circular, but had a concave
surface on the inner side; occasionally its corners were rounded
off, producing a reniform shape. On an average the diameter
was something like four or five inches. This implement was
used exclusively to scrape skins of animals, after the following
fashion: The convex surface was pressed against the palm of
the right hand and securely held between the body of the thumb
and the four fingers. The skin was laid around a cylindrical
rod and held firmly against it with the opposite hand, while the
implement was placed over the skin with its concave surface
so adjusted as to fit over the convexity of the rod. In this
position, the scraper was worked downwards, or towards the
native, with its concave surface running ahead of the hand and
shaving the skin. Thus the skins were thoroughly cleaned, and
all adherent pieces of fat and flesh removed. Slate scrapers of
this type are still to be found in large number in the drift
sands along the shores of St. Vincent’s Gulf, especially in the
neighbourhood of Normanville. Vide <a href="#plate43">Plate XLIII</a>, 3.</p>

<p>Most types of spear-thrower carry a scraper embedded in a
mass of resin or wax at the handle end. The scraper most
favoured is either of quartzite or of flint, about an inch or
slightly more square, and chipped on one or both sides of the
cutting edge. It is almost wholly embedded, with perhaps only
the chipped portion showing below the binding mass which
helps to form the handle.</p>

<p>Similar stones are fixed at both ends of a curved or straight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
piece of wood, of circular section, which is then used as a
scraping or chopping tool commonly referred to as an adze.
Used as a scraper, the wooden handle is gripped at about one-quarter
its length from the bottom, both hands being at the
same level, with their fingers overlapping and the thumbs lying
against the wood on the opposite side; but when used as a
chopper the hands are held one over the other, each clenching
the handle separately. Occasionally one hand only is used to
direct the tool, while the other holds the object to be worked
(<a href="#plate55">Plate LV</a>, 1).</p>

<p>The small, sharp flakes which are chipped from a bigger
piece during the construction of a scraper are carefully examined
and the most shapely of them are collected for the purpose of
sticking them lengthwise, one behind the other, to the two
edges of a bladed, wooden spear head. This type of spear was
common along the lower reaches of the Murray River and
Lake Alexandrina.</p>

<p>In Western Australia a special type of knife called “<i>dabba</i>”
is constructed in a like way, but the flakes are larger, three-quarters
of an inch long, and embedded in resin along one side
only of the stick. The implement measures about two feet
in length.</p>

<p>The long, single flakes, obtained from a quartzite core, may
be further chipped along the edges to sharpen them. This process
is seen typically along the coastal districts of the Northern
Territory, the Daly and Victoria River districts in particular.</p>

<p>But where the manufacture of stone spear heads is seen to
perfection is in the northern Kimberleys of Western Australia.
The north-western tribes are expert at making lanceolate spear
heads with serrated edges and beautifully facetted sides; some
of the specimens are up to six inches long and are delicately
chipped all over. People who have not had the opportunity of
witnessing the method employed in making them are perplexed
to understand how it is possible to accomplish such delicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
work without breaking the object; the point in particular of
these spear heads is often nearly as fine as that of a needle.</p>

<p>The way it is done is briefly as follows. A rough flake or
fragment is broken from a core, or rock <i>in situ</i>, by holding a
bone chisel or stone adze in much the same way as one clasps
a pen or pencil, and stabbing the block near the sharp edge,
or by striking it with another rock fragment. The size of the
flake thus detached will depend largely upon the purpose to
which it is to be put; the fractured surface is always plane.
The fragment is now taken in the left hand, its flat surfaces
lying full length between the thumb and fingers, and its edges
chipped by striking them from above with a sharp stone hammer
held securely in the right hand. The flake is frequently changed
about, so that what is now the bottom surface later becomes
the top. The edge is always struck nearly at right angles to
the flat surface whilst the chips break away into the hand
underneath. The Yampi Sound natives call the rough primary
flake “<i>munna</i>,” and the small chips resulting from the trimming
of its edge “<i>aroap</i>.”</p>

<p>The original shaping aims at obtaining a roughly symmetrical
leaf-form, truncated at the base where it is subsequently to be
embedded or held at the end of a spear or haft. The flake is
left thick at its base and made to taper towards its point.</p>

<p>At first the chipping is done by fairly strong, but well-directed
blows from above; later by quicker and lighter taps.
Occasionally the edges are rasped with a flat slab of sandstone
at right angles to the plane of the flake—a process which breaks
away small chips from either side of the edge which is being
rubbed. The flake at this stage is called “<i>ardelgulla</i>” by the
Yampi natives, and “<i>arolonnyenna</i>” by the Sunday Islanders.</p>

<p>4. Rock-drawing of fish.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the preliminary shaping has been completed in the
way described, the native first strives to obtain a perfect point,
then to trim the sides. The former item is a very delicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
operation which requires much patience and skill; the latter
takes many hours to complete.</p>

<p>The method adopted for this finer secondary chipping process
is after the following principle. A block of stone, about a
foot cube, is used as a working table or anvil, which the Worora
call “<i>muna</i>,” and upon this they lay a cushion consisting of two
or three layers of paper-bark, called “<i>ngali</i>.” The native sits
with the stone in front of him, and in his left hand grips the
unfinished spear head (“<i>ardegulla</i>”) with one of its flat surfaces
lying upon the cushion at the near, left-hand corner of
the anvil stone. His thumb, index, and middle fingers hold the
flake, the thumb being on top, the index finger against the edge,
and the middle finger beneath; the two remaining fingers press
against the edge of the block below to steady the flake upon
the cushion. In his right hand he seizes a short rod of bone,
which is sharpened at one end, and is known as “<i>onumongul</i>,”
in such a way that the unsharpened end is securely gripped between
the thumb and index finger, whilst the principal portion
of the rod is pressed with the remaining fingers against the palm
of the hand immediately below the body of the thumb. The
sharpened point of the bone thus points towards the native’s
body. Holding the implement in this position, he rests the
small-finger side of his hand near the further right-hand corner
of the basal block of stone, and, after carefully adjusting the
point of the bone against the edge of the flake, he presses it
down with the body of his thumb and skilfully snaps off a chip.
The process is repeated again, and time after time, the position
of the bone being constantly changed as he works along the
edge towards the point. Then the flake is turned on its other
side and the same method applied. As the native works, the
whole of his attention is absorbed. He bites his lips together,
and, when he applies leverage with the bone against the flake,
he stiffens his body from the hips upwards, his eyes being
rivetted to the spot from which the chip is to be removed. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
frequently sharpens the point of his instrument upon the basal
block of stone. Vide <a href="#plate54">Plate LIV</a>, 2.</p>

<p>The most delicate final chipping of both the point and margins
is executed with a thinner and more finely pointed bone,
which is usually made out of the radius of a kangaroo. In
districts coming under the influence of European settlement,
the bone is often substituted by a piece of iron, and the stone
by bottle glass or porcelain.</p>

<p>During the operation the native often cuts his fingers on the
flake or razor-sharp splinters; the blood which follows he removes
by passing his fingers through his hair. Even at this
stage, when the flake is assuming a symmetrical, lanceolate
shape, and goes by the name of “<i>tanbellena</i>,” its edge might
occasionally be very carefully rubbed on the basal stone; but the
final <i>retouche</i> is invariably given to it with the bone implement.</p>

<p>At no time during the making of the spear head does the
native use his wrist, the whole of the pressure or movement
coming from his elbow or even from his waist, while his body
is kept in the rigid position referred to above. The finished
spear head is called “<i>ngongu nerbai</i>” or “<i>kolldürr</i>.”</p>

<p>The process described is of such a delicate kind that the
point not infrequently breaks just when the spear head is practically
ready for use; this necessitates not only the construction
of a new point, but the margins on both sides of it have to be
chipped back in order that the point may be a projecting one.</p>

<p>One has to admire the industry of these men, when it is
realized that the spear head in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred
will be good for only one throw, the brittle stone shattering
immediately it comes into contact with a solid body such
as the bone of the prey or the ground.</p>

<p>An aboriginal is a born mimic. Nothing delights him more
than to reproduce from Nature incidences and scenes before
an appreciative and visionary audience. But in the same sense
as detail of design in his drawings or carvings is often deemed
unnecessary by his vivid imagination, so to the outsider his
acting might seem tainted with an air of becoming vagueness
which makes it appear pantomimic. Yet, as a conversationalist,
an aboriginal is usually so animated by the recollections of his
experience that he unconsciously becomes a dramatist, and his
narration an epic. Granted the necessary perception, however,
the feelings and emotions which actuate the performer are
readily grasped by those observing his dances, and whose sympathy
he is courting. He lets himself go, without mock-modest
constraint, endeavouring by every action to interpret with his
body the impulse he has received. Lured by the glint of an
inspiration, his nearer vision is blinded, his musculature quivers
involuntarily, and his only desire is to catch, to imitate, and to
give expression to his exalted feelings. Held in a rapture, his
feelings transcend anything he ordinarily perceives, his staid
personality has vanished, and all that the inner individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
attempts, or can attempt, is to externalize by his movements
those sensuous, but illusive, impressions his soul is imbibing.</p>

<p>To many the real interpretation of such movement would
be impossible; but the aboriginal lives for his dances, of which
he possesses an almost inexhaustible variety, the outcome of
tradition and invention. He has learned to make his dance a
medium of sensual expression, and to combine an instinctive
impulse with movement. By his dancing he impersonates both
friend and enemy, he copies the hopping of a marsupial, or the
wriggling of a serpent, or the strutting of an emu, and he
emulates the legendary practices and sacred ceremonials of his
forefathers. In his dances lives the valour of his warriors, and
dies the evil magic of his foes. Through his dances he endeavours
to commune with the spirits of his dead, he hears the
voices of his mythical demigods, and he beseeches his deities
to protect his person and to bless his haunts with an abundance
of game.</p>

<p>The magnetical charm about a tribal dance lies in the
rhythmic motion of the performers, in the harmonious way
their naked bodies sway to the accompaniment of crude but
effective music, and in the clever association of sound with
motion and silence with rest. The dancers are mute during
their performance, the music being supplied by a band or
chorus of either men or women, or both, who squat near by.
A performance without musical items is practically unknown.
The dancers keep their movements and steps in such remarkably
true accord with the vocal and instrumental parts that it is
difficult to dissociate one from another; in addition, the rhythm
for each new dance is usually set by the audience and followed
by the dancers to the instant.</p>

<p>The beating of time is usually done by hand, especially if
women are attending the performance. In most tribes, the
person squats on the ground, holding the thighs together, and
strikes the cleft thus produced with the palm of a hand. More<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
commonly both hands are used together, with the inner side of
one laid over the back of the other, and the fingers of the
lower one placed together in such a way as to form a concave
surface. By this means, loud, explosive sounds are produced.</p>

<p>On Melville and Bathurst Islands, and on the Victoria
River, the palms of both hands are struck against the buttocks,
one on either side of the body, while the person is standing.
Along the coast of the Northern Territory, the natives, as
often as not, simply clap the hands in rhythmic order, or they
slap the palms of one or both upon the ground; occasionally
one even notices mothers gently slapping the buttocks of their
babies-in-arms, all under the impulse of a catchy air which is
striking their ears.</p>

<p>A peculiar sort of sound accompaniment is rendered by the
women dancers of the Katherine and Victoria River districts
of the Northern Territory. As each of the dancers hops forwards
in a straight line, with her heels together and her feet
turned outwards, she jerks her body in mid-air and whacks the
muscles of her thighs together, an act which produces a loud,
sharp sound. In this way she moves both forwards and backwards,
making a similar noise with every hop, whilst her feet
make a track in the sand which is to represent the female
turtle coming on shore to lay its eggs.</p>

<p>In the same districts, as well as on the Daly River, the
dancing gins use skeins of string stretched between the thumbs
of their hands, which they sway to and fro like the bow of a
fiddle. Although this manoeuvre does not produce a sound, it
is here mentioned because the movement takes place in perfect
rhythm and in unison with the singing which is going on; and
one is reminded of a modern conductor using his stick.</p>

<p>If we now turn our attention to the consideration of the
accompaniment produced with musical instruments, there is a
small choice at our disposal. We find that certain of the
southern tribes, along the River Murray, made use of skins,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
which they stretched across their thighs, as they sat upon the
ground, and struck with their hands or a stick like beating
a drum.</p>

<p>In the Kimberley district of Western Australia, the large
nuts of the boabab, when dry, are used after the style of the
European toy known as a baby’s rattle by the children, but
curiosity soon leads to the destruction of the shell, when the
pithy matrix and the seeds are eaten. Occasionally these nuts
are introduced into ceremonial dances by the men; they are
then elaborately and beautifully carved as previously referred
to.</p>

<p>In the same district, and in fact all along the north coast,
large convoluted sea-shells with a small pebble inside of them,
or even a number of smaller shells threaded upon a string,
serve the same purpose of noise-making.</p>

<p>Bundles of gum leaves, fresh or dry, tied round the ankles
or arms of the performers, produce a rustle which imitates the
noise produced by the wiry feathers of a romping emu. Most
of the tribes adopt this scheme, especially in connection with
sacred festivals and ceremonies having to do with the emu.</p>

<p>Among the central and northern central tribes, the boomerang
is extensively used as a musical instrument. The operator,
taking up a squatting position, holds a boomerang at half-arm’s
length in each hand, so that the concave edges are turned towards
his body. Then by bringing the instruments near each
other, with their surfaces parallel, he claps their ends together
in quick succession, and by so doing produces rhythmic clanks
to suit the step of any dance or the time of any song (<a href="#plate52">Plate LII</a>).</p>

<p>The Larrekiya, Wogait, Berringin, and other Northern
Territory tribes make use of “music sticks.” Two of such are
required. One is of hard “iron-wood,” about nine inches in
length, flatly cylindrical, and bluntly pointed at one end; the
other, which is the beating stick, is simply a smaller rod, of
circular section, made of light mangrove wood. The former<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
stick is held firmly in the left hand, whilst it is struck by the
latter, not far from its end. The beating stick is held in the
right hand with one end of it pressing either against the third
or fifth finger. The sounds produced by the percussion are
ringing, sub-metallic clanks; and any alteration in the length
of the free end of the beating stick naturally tends to vary
their pitch.</p>

<p>The instrument which is capable of producing the loudest,
and, at the same time, most weird sound, when correctly manipulated
by an aboriginal, is the bamboo trumpet, otherwise
known as the drone-pipe or “<i>didjeridoo</i>.” This consists of a
piece of bamboo, of the stout, tropical variety, from four to
five feet long, the septa of which have all been burnt out with
a fire-stick. The outside surface is decorated with engraved
designs. Drone-pipes are used by all coastal tribes living between
the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cambridge Gulf, and as
far inland as Wave Hill on the Victoria River. Where the
bamboo is not available, the instrument is made out of a long
hollow limb of the woolly-butt eucalyptus; this is the prevailing
type in the western portion of the area mentioned. To serve the
requirements of a single night’s performance, a green stem of
a native hybiscus bush might be cut off and the thick bark
removed <i>in toto</i> in the form of a pipe.</p>

<p>When using the “trumpet,” the operator blows into the end
having the smaller diameter, with a vibratory motion of the
lips, and at the same time sputters into the tube indistinct
words which frequently sound like “<i>tidjarudu, tidjarudu, tidjaruda</i>”
(<a href="#plate53">Plate LIII</a>). The effect, though rhythmical, is a
monotonous, plaintive, and humming sound which is continued
uninterruptedly throughout the proceedings. The native, while
he is blowing into the pipe, continues to breathe normally
through his nostrils, after the same style as one does when using
a blow-pipe in the laboratory. In the stillness of the tropical
night the droning noise can be heard for miles around. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
wording of the accompaniment on the bamboo trumpet during
a Larrekiya performance sounds much like the following refrain:
“<i>Didnodiddo diduadu didnadiddo diduadu ... didnarib</i>.”</p>

<p>In addition to music and dance, a unique, and certainly most
effective, pyrotechnical embellishment of a nocturnal ceremony
is supplied by the Dieri. Along the Cooper Creek, travellers
have occasion to notice the great number of large beetles which
fly towards the camp-fire at night-time. When a dance is on,
a collection of these beetles is made and short glowing embers
inserted into their anal apertures; whereupon they are released
again. As the naked figures of the men are moving to the
sway of song, these little fire-balls buzz and flit in among
them, and, cruel as the invention may seem, greatly add to the
weirdness of the din. The Dieri call these artificial fire-flies
“<i>turapitti</i>.”</p>

<p>Vocal productions consist of recitals of notes which are frequently
encased in articulations without definite meaning or
significance, the notes alone expressing the sentiment which
prompts the song. It is the combination of these notes which
gives rise to the simple melodies, and the repetition of the
melodies in regular sequence makes the song. In his songs the
aboriginal portrays the hate for his foe with vehemence, the
love for his child with affection, the spirit of the chase with
lustfulness, the cunning of his prey with counter-deception, and
the dignity of his forbears with veneration. As the pulsations
of his temperament and passion sway his mind, so his voice
rises or falls in harmony with the flush of joy or the gloom of
sorrow.</p>

<p>When singing in chorus, the monotony of a melody is frequently
re-animated by one of the principal singers, who, with
a stentorian inflection of his voice, leads off anew. In this
way, the pitch of a melody is repeatedly altered by one or two
of the recognized vocal experts; but at all times the pitch relations
remain in perfect concord with each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span></p>

<p>It is considered distinctly artistic to be able to frequently
change the pitch of the voice from a deep bass to a shrill
falsetto at will, and only the most experienced singers attempt
it. A new tune is introduced by one of the older men, and
the same person will later infuse new vitality into it by picking
up the strain at different stages by a clever inflection of the
voice, after the style of a rondo.</p>

<p>The rhythm throughout the proceedings remains excellent,
but great variations are met with during the rendering of
different items; it is always in keeping with the dance, if the
latter is indulged in, even at the risk of running away momentarily
from the time of the music.</p>

<p>Performances which include dances as well as songs in the
way of entertainment are generally called corrobborees; events
of a ceremonial, ritual, or religious nature are termed “<i>boras</i>.”</p>

<p>The notes included in the songs of tribal performances are
often imitative of the voice of Nature, and among them we
find allusions to the calls and cries of birds, animals, reptiles,
and mythical creatures. At the same time, any characteristic
actions or attitudes are faithfully reproduced as special features
of the dances.</p>

<p>In the crocodile ceremony of the Cambridge Gulf natives, a
number of men stand in a row, one behind the other, with their
arms extended and their legs asunder, whilst the individual
impersonating the crocodile ancestor wriggles along the ground
between their legs. When he comes abreast of the foremost
man, he lies flat on the ground, with his legs and feet held
closely together to imitate the reptile’s tail. To further mimic
the crocodile, he extends his arms sideways, strongly bent at
the elbows, and with the hands flat upon the ground. Retaining
this position, he next elevates his body by straightening
his arms, and, when fully erect, opens his mouth and emits a
harsh, booming note resembling that of a crocodile.</p>

<p>In the same district, the great emu man, during his ceremony,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
walks within a human circle, his body prone from the hips,
with one arm held forwards to represent the emu’s neck and
the hand of the other held over his stern to indicate the tail.
As he walks around bowing his body, after the fashion of a
strutting emu, he eructates deep, guttural noises, resembling
the grunting note of the bird.</p>

<p>How the caw of a crow is embodied in the musical programme
of a ceremony will be apparent from the following
episode which was transacted at the Forrest River. A number
of men stood in a ring, and, at a given signal, lowered their
bodies between their knees. They let their heads fall forwards,
and at the same time lifted their arms, which they bent in the
elbow to resemble wings. The latter they moved lithely to
and fro after much the same way as a young bird does when
it is being, or wants to be, fed. At this moment a chant was
started in imitation of the crow’s call: “<i>A wa, a wa, a weh!</i>”
and was ofttimes repeated. Then they all hopped around like
so many birds in search of food, and two men entered the
ring. Still in the same posture, these two hopped towards
each other and extended their arms until each pair crossed the
opposite pair. In that position they swung their bodies backwards
and forwards, whilst their arms sea-sawed in front of
them. Then they re-joined the group, and all continued the
hopping. In the next act, an old man lay flat on his back,
in the centre of the ring, with his arms and legs stretched from
him. He represented a carcase. The “crows” hopped around
him and cried: “<i>A, a, a, la, la, la-la-la</i>,” and it sounded very
much like the caw of a crow. This item was repeated. One
of the crow men then hopped to the “dead” man. He lifted
one of the arms from the ground, held it up, and let it go.
The limb fell “lifelessly” to the ground. Immediately this had
happened, all performers jumped into an upright position,
rushed towards the man feigning death, and carried him from
view. Apart from the imitation of the crow’s call, no regular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
song accompanied the act, but all the onlookers were beating
time, to correspond with the hopping, by slapping their hands
against their thighs.</p>

<p>The vocal accompaniment at a ceremony of welcome on
Bathurst Island is in the form of a trill, a rapidly repeated
“<i>i, i, i, i, i ...</i>,” changing occasionally to “<i>hi, hi, hi, hi ...</i>,”
which is very cleverly reproduced in imitation of the note of
the great stone plover.</p>

<p>In the corrobboree of a frog, the Larrekiya sing the following
refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Iwoggiama wogien woggiamana wogien, immangana jellerrima wogien.</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Imbaka kwuerakwa wogien. Imbelluoluodö wogien.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then they pause for a moment, and, continuing immediately,
mimic the croaking by crying:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Yi kwa e kwa, yi kwa e kwa!</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The singing is assisted by an accompaniment on the bamboo
trumpet which sounds like: “<i>Tip bu, tip bu, tip bu, tip pau-a,
tip pau-a, tip pau-a</i>.” Music sticks are used by all taking part
in the corrobboree, the percussions being equally timed and of
uniform strength.</p>

<p>A little performance, melodramatic in a way, which is very
popular with the Larrekiya and Wogait in the Northern Territory,
is designed to scoff at the wailing of women. It is
introduced by the following refrain:</p>

<p>“<i>Arada kadji mara uda kayan yan; arada kadji mara uda
kayan mölle ulpululu mölle, jangaji karra kanjin mada da nga
la ulmin ja jandadbi karra kun kun mukale la enbulukdi bana
mölle mara kanjinmada da buluk di bölle arada kadji balla.</i>”</p>

<p>Then the wailing begins. With a pathos and sincerity so
cleverly feigned that one might easily be led to believe they
are genuine, the men strike up a lament which is thrilling.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
Monosyllabic sounds pierce the air, which terminate with a sob:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Lö -e, lö, lö -e, lö -ö, lö -ö la</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then a burst of laughter ends the solemnity; and the refrain
is continued amidst much hilarity:</p>

<p>“<i>Kanjin mada danö wüdningi juan madji karra kunkul mukana
mölle enbuluk di bana mälle kanjin mada</i>.”</p>

<p>At the conclusion, a general criticism takes place of the skill
displayed by the different performers in the reproduction of
the effeminate sounds. Throughout the proceedings an accompaniment
is played on the bamboo trumpet sounding like: “<i>Tib
bu, tib bu, tib bu-a</i>”; whilst a number of men beat their music
sticks in a rhythm represented by one long and three short taps.</p>

<p>The Bathurst and Melville Islanders are famous for their
impressive ceremonies. At most of them, a group of men stand
in a semi-circle and supply the accompaniment by clapping one
or both hands against thigh or buttock, producing dull, drum-like
sounds by the impact; they further supplement the
rhythmic sounds by crying, “<i>brr, brr, brr</i>” in unison with the
beating. Any actors who enter the ring in front of these men
frequently ejaculate a sound like a short “<i>poop</i>,” and this immediately
solicits a concerted “<i>iah</i>” from all taking part.</p>

<p>In their corrobboree of the jungle fowl, an old man rushes
into the ring, bending his arms at the elbow and holding them
close against his body, while he rests his closed fists upon his
chest. His attitude resembles that of a professional runner,
although in reality his arms are supposed to represent the wings
of the bird. The man looks about the ground, from side to
side, as though in search of something. Presently he imitates
the familiar call of the bird, with a shrill penetrating voice,
which sounds like “<i>he-r-r-r-l</i>.” In answer to this, the chorus
surrounding him spontaneously gives utterance to a number of
short, non-articulate noises which sound like “<i>brrl, brrl, brrl</i>,”
and are claimed to be the call of the bird’s mate. From now
on the performer intermittently cries “<i>he</i>,” and, every time he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
does so, the rest of the men respond with a loud “<i>yeh</i>.” Then
he throws sand and clouds of dust behind him with his feet,
with the object of imitating the way a jungle fowl throws up
earth into large mounds in which its eggs are deposited.</p>

<p>When the kangaroo ceremony is announced, one or two men
jump into the ring, with their legs slightly bent at the knees.
Their arms are held forward, bent vertically at the elbows,
their hands being kept prone and partly closed. The whole
posture is to resemble that of the hopping marsupial of Australia.
In jumping round the space, the actor turns his head
from side to side, face downwards, as though in search of food.
When such is supposed to have been found, his hands may
assist to support his body and the hopping ceases. His legs are
then bent strongly in the knees, so that his body sinks and his
buttocks come to rest immediately above the heels, or, indeed,
he may squat entirely upon the ground. He now holds his
hands together and passes them between his thighs to the
ground, from which he scoops a quantity of sand and lifts it
to the level of his mouth. Suddenly dropping the sand, the
performer bounds to his feet and runs round the ring, vigorously
stamping his feet and making a peculiar hissing sound. The act
is frequently interrupted by cries of “<i>poop</i>” from the mouths of
the saltant men, which are immediately responded to by the
crowd with a boisterous “<i>iah</i>.” Then the hopping re-commences,
the actor frequently stopping to scratch his leg with
one of his hands held like a claw. Occasionally he lifts an
arm to his mouth to lick it just like the animal itself does.
The pace of the time-beaters at this stage quickens, and the
actor begins to scratch all accessible parts of his body as if
possessed. An unexpected “<i>poop</i>,” followed by a hearty “<i>iah</i>,”
terminates this part of the performance amid loud shrieks and
applause.</p>

<p>It is not long before two performers again leap into the
ring, each armed with a light reed in his hand, resembling a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
spear. The above demonstration is partly recapitulated, being,
however, slightly modified in that one man, at intervals, takes
the part of a hunter endeavouring to drive his spear into the
enraged “kangaroo” on the opposite side of the ring.</p>

<p>The corrobboree of a fight is presented by an imaginary spear
duel between two angry men. They are “armed” with a light
reed each, and upon entering the arena, composed of the time-beating
chorus, place themselves in defiance of each other and
cut all sorts of antics. They brandish their imaginary weapons,
roll their eyes, and throw their bodies about wildly. Then
they start running around the ring, slapping their thighs together,
with their heads thrown back and their arms upwards.</p>

<p>As an instance of the clever way in which aborigines mimic
special happenings or striking episodes, and also hand on the
records to subsequent generations, the ship-of-war corrobboree
is here briefly outlined. This is a reproduction of events
which happened at Fort Dundas about a century ago, but the
present day natives still enjoy looking at it and include it
among their favourite turns. After the usual preliminaries, a
performer rushes into the ring and stands with one leg in front
of the other and slightly flexed in the knee. Throwing his
head back and looking upwards, he starts a vigorous “hauling
action” by alternately throwing one arm out in the direction
he is looking, closing the fist and making an imaginary pull
right down to his loins, while at the same time the other arm
is thrown out and returned in a similar way. This act is in
imitation of the hauling in of a sail on a European man-of-war,
and is rhythmically followed by the time-beaters. Running to
the opposite side of the ring, the same act is repeated. Then
the same hauling motion is continued, but this time pulling
from below upwards towards the body, in a manner suggesting
the heaving of an anchor. During this performance, several
sharp and harsh interjections are heard, which suggest a skit
on the orders of the commanding officers; in fact, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
ceremony is to be looked upon as a travesty of naval discipline.</p>

<p>During several of the performances described above, the following
chant was heard, in perfect accord with the rhythmic
smacks produced by the hands of the chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Tupera monan la jerra</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Tupera monan la jerra</i>,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>Tupatunan tenakomejona</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Fowler’s Bay, the men like no dance so much as one
which caricatures a woman on a collecting excursion. The
performer walks from the darkness of night into the bright
glare produced by the camp-fire, with an exaggerated bend of
the knees and a loudly perceptible stamp of the feet. Over one
of his shoulders he carries a collecting bag, and as he moves
forwards and sideways, his eyes are rivetted to the ground in
front of him; he is supposed to be looking for food-stuffs.
Suddenly he stops, stoops, and feigns to be picking up something,
which is assigned to the bag. Then he hurries on and
repeats the same performance. Whilst he is acting thus, the
audience, grouped at one side of the fire, is diligently beating
time to his steps by knocking two boomerangs (“<i>kaili</i>”) together.</p>

<p>In another act he walks quickly into the light, stops suddenly,
and looks hard at the ground in front of him. Presently
he lifts his right foot, only to immediately bring it back
to the ground again with a thud. Emitting a squeal like that
of a dying or wounded bandicoot, he stoops and makes out he
is lifting his prey triumphantly into the air.</p>

<p>Yet another performance portrays the slaying of an enemy.
A second actor, who represents the vanquished foe, is requested
to lie in the centre of the arena, whilst the victor dances around
him, wildly flourishing and swinging his club. Every now and
then the ground is bashed with the heavy weapon as near to
the prostrate figure as possible; and after every blow the fallen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
warrior is seen to writhe his body between the legs of the
victor as if he were really suffering terrible agony.</p>

<p>An aboriginal often sings to himself for no other purpose
than for his own entertainment, in which occupation he manifests
considerable pleasure, and repeats the tune to his heart’s
content, at times almost to the verge of physical exhaustion.
In his endeavour to become a noted singer amongst his tribespeople,
a man at every opportunity stimulates his ambition.
He listens with envy to the tireless chirping of a cricket and
suggests to himself the advantages of acquiring such powers of
vocal endurance (as he imagines them to be). The Larrekiya
youths admire the large <i>Cicadae</i> for similar reasons; and they
do not hesitate, upon occasions, to catch one or two of the
winged music-makers and suck their viscera, hoping thereby to
acquire increased musical talent.</p>

<p>When singing ensemble, the musical productions have widely
varying purposes and meanings. The performance might be
purely convivial and entertaining, when a number of refrains
are hummed or sung, solo and collectively, to the combined
accompaniment which is rendered by most of the others present.
Any attempt at harmony is wanting. Boisterous music can
always be counted upon at tribal war-dances, when the excited
and infuriated mobs almost lose control of their reason, and by
singing to their ancestral fathers endeavour to bring destruction
upon the enemy by the wildest imprecatory acts.</p>

<p>At initiation ceremonies, the old men, at the time of spilling
the novice’s blood, are no less excited; and the musical items
are reduced to hoarse, rude utterances of a decidedly disquieting
flavour. Under these conditions the soul of a true savage unmasks
itself. It speaks in coarse, disconnected sounds which
are hardly recognizable as human, but, at the moment, none
the less in sympathy with his inner feelings.</p>

</figure>

<p>On the other hand, the music which is produced at religious
ceremonies is quieter and of a more ding-dong style. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
natives present their sacred chants, which they have inherited
from their forefathers, for the purpose of getting into communion
with the spirits surrounding them; and, although such
proceedings may be extremely monotonous, the solemn colloquy
is nevertheless musical.</p>

<p>It is a common practice, for that matter, among the tribes
of Australia, for one individual to carry on conversation with
another by singing the words. When, for instance, it is the
intention of the persons engaged in conversation to make the
matter as little noticeable as possible, or when they want to
impart information to each other without attracting the attention
of a third party, they clothe their words in song. And
the same is also done when a third party is to be criticized.
Moreover, it is for exactly similar reasons that all communications
which are supposed to be carried on with superhuman
beings are chanted or crooned, in order that the Evil Spirit’s
attention may not be drawn to the fact.</p>

<span class="smaller">LANGUAGE</span></h2>

<p>Aboriginal dialects euphonious and full—Words largely imitative of
natural call-notes—Derivations from other characteristics—Linguistic
generalizations impossible—Vocabularies replete in certain
directions—Gesture and sign languages—Passionate conversationalist—Reckoning
of time—Computation of numbers—Word expressing
action—Terminal syllables—Affirmation and negation—Exclamations—Specific
suffixes—Diminutive expressions—Verb endings—Word
with a variety of meanings—Personal pronouns—Aspirate
sounds rare—Consonantal combination “<i>ng</i>” very frequent—Greetings—Exclamation
and Interrogative—Curious Similarities.</p>

</div>

<p>As full as the aboriginal legends are of poetry, so their
dialects are full of music. For euphony, fullness, and vowel
quality, few modern languages equal the primitive tongue; and
much of the charm is derived from a natural source. Even in
our own language, the vernacular name of a bird or animal
is often derived from the particular call made by the creature.
In Europe we have christened the cuckoo, the peewit, and the
boo-book owl because of their distinctive cries; in a like sense,
the central Australian natives call the bell-bird “<i>ban-ban-balele</i>,”
the mopoke “<i>kore-gore</i>,” and the spur-wing plover
“<i>kurreke-tar-tar</i>,” all three names being sounded like the
natural cries of the birds themselves.</p>

<p>As further illustrations we might mention the Dieri and
Arunndta word for kangaroo, viz. “<i>arre</i>,” which, one is told,
is what the animal “says” when brought to bay, and the Sunday
Islanders’ name for a grasshopper, “<i>dingi-ding</i>,” which alludes
to its chirrup.</p>

<p>In regard to the coining of words, quite apart from the
sonorous qualities the object named might possess, the aboriginal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
is no less inventive. The Arunndta call thunder
“<i>kwatche-ingoma</i>,” i.e. “roaring water,” and a sharp shower of
rain pattering on the ground “<i>kwatche unndoma</i>,” i.e. “dancing
water.” What is commonly known as the milk-bush in Australia
(<i>Sarcostemma</i>) is called “<i>epi-epi</i>” by the Aluridja because
it exudes a milk-like sap when broken and reminds them
of the female breast (“<i>epi</i>”). Kangaroo grass (<i>Anthistiria</i>) is
referred to by the Arunndta as “<i>arre-arre</i>” because, they maintain,
the red colour of its seed stalks resembles that of the marsupial.
The Arunndta for the familiar beef-wood tree of
central Australia is “<i>iltjija</i>,” meaning long fingers, the word
drawing attention to the length of the leaves.</p>

<p>Whereas in our own language words like “choleric” have
originated because the bile in a human system was supposed to
beget wrath, and whereas one bushman might accuse another
of being “livery” when he is ill-tempered, the Arunndta have
a verb, “<i>lunbatunbatterama</i>,” meaning to grumble or to be
sulky, in which “<i>unba</i>” stands for bile.</p>

<p>In view of the great number of Australian tribes and the
multiplicity of their dialects, any attempt at linguistic generalizations
would seem to be futile, when often even adjoining
tribes have adopted totally different vocabularies for the most
common commodities of life. As a matter of fact, the groups
which build up one and the same big tribe often have considerable
differences in their vocabularies. For instance, the eastern
groups of the Arunndta make use of very many words and expressions
which are quite foreign to the western. Yet in respect
of certain words, it is known that with slight modifications
their significance has carried far beyond the borders of a single
tribe and has been accepted by a group of tribes living up to a
few hundred miles apart.</p>

<p>Although the aboriginal tongue is crude in its construction,
it is, nevertheless, wonderfully rich and scientifically exact.
Whereas a modern language becomes very commonplace in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
ordinary course of conversation, and is inclined to handle subject
matter somewhat flippantly, the aboriginal system of
nomenclature is both profuse and incontrovertible. During his
descriptive narrations from Nature, a European rarely bothers
about discriminating between objects composing one big class.
If he talks of a forest, he is usually satisfied to convey the idea
of a number of trees standing collectively at the site his story
is dealing with; if he wishes to be exact he might specially describe
the trees as pines or gums. But the aboriginal wants,
and gives, more; his vocabulary, in fact, rarely includes such
words as “tree,” “animal,” “meat,” or “seed”; he tells you
immediately, without being specially asked, that the “tree” is
a gum, the “animal” a wallaby, the “meat” that of kangaroo,
and the “seed” that of the water-lily. Moreover, his verbal
supply is so copious that in a single word he can tell one the
name, the age, the habitat, and many characteristics.</p>

<p>A language without words is known to most Australian natives;
thoughts and messages are communicated by means of
gestures from individual to individual, and from tribe to tribe.
This system is so perfect, and the code so well understood by
all, that important tidings are transmitted from one centre to
another in incredibly short time. The method might to a
certain extent be compared with the flag-signalling of a marine;
it is too complicated to be discussed in detail, but we shall
select a few code signals by way of illustration.</p>

<p><i>Halloa!</i> To attract the attention of a person whom conversation
is to be taken up with, the native, standing as erect
as possible, and with his legs astride, lifts his hands to his head
and swings them outwards (in opposite directions), downwards,
and upwards again, time after time. Whilst doing so,
he calls aloud, with a shrill, piercing note, even though the
other fellow be well beyond hearing distance.</p>

</figure>

<p><i>Come here!</i> Maintaining the erect position, he throws both

<p>An intricate system of sign language is carried on by movements
of the hands and fingers when the natives are at close
enough range for the signals to be visible. The following are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
a few of the more common signs used every day by the
Arunndta tribe:</p>

<p>To call the attention of a person, a man holds his open hand
in front of his face, with the palm towards him, and drops it
again. The sign having been acknowledged, a mutual exchange
of gesture correspondence is indulged in, by means of which
an almost inexhaustible number of ideas can be communicated
in the form of coherent “speech.” The following few signs
(most of which are sketched on <a href="#figure57">page 391, Fig. 57</a>) may be
taken as typical of a vocabulary which in its entirety is both
elaborate and intricate:</p>

<p>In the course of conversation, an aboriginal aids his speech
by gesticulation. When inclined to be cheerful, he smiles and
laughs in a decidedly refreshing sort of way, and often smacks
his lips out of sheer pleasure, but when his feelings have been
ruffled and he is angry, he pouts out his lips and does not
hesitate to let you know how he feels. He betrays his feelings
by most apparent tone inflections in his voice. He frequently
nods his head to indicate assent, but rarely shakes his head to
betoken dissent. When in doubt over any matter, especially in
answer to a question, he shrugs his shoulders. His hands are
used a great deal during conversation. If he wishes to give
one an idea of nearness, the finger is directed to the ground a
short way off, and if distance is implied the finger points to
the horizon.</p>

<p>In reply to a question concerned with the location of a thing,
he does not point, as a European would, but turns his face in
the direction he wants to indicate and thrusts out his lips.
When beckoning with his hand, an aboriginal does not move
his hand upwards towards his face as we do, but passes it
downwards with a scooping action. The course a traveller
has taken, or an animal decamped in, is indicated by extending
an arm in the direction and snapping the fingers.</p>

<p>A native has a very good idea of time. The hour at which
a past event has happened, or at which a coming event is to
happen, is indicated by pointing at the assumed altitude of the
sun. To fix a time definitely for a contemplated or proposed
action, a stone is placed upon a cliff, or in the fork of a tree,
at the hour decided upon, a day or two in advance, in such a
position that a sunbeam just strikes it at the moment. When
the correct day arrives, the stone is watched until it is again
illumined in the same way; and the natives then know that it
is time to act. This method is employed when, say, the men
have left camp early, and they order the women to follow them
at a later hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span></p>

<p>Days are reckoned by the number of sleeps they have had,
and the biggest measurement of time goes by so many moons.</p>

<p>When he comes to computing numbers, his fingers are of the
greatest service to him, and at times his toes as well. An
aboriginal is not a mathematician, and his vocabulary does not
contain running series of numerals. The usual method of
counting low figures is after the following pattern of the King
Sound natives:</p>

<ul>
<li>“<i>arra</i>” (one).</li>
<li>“<i>kwiarra</i>” (two).</li>
<li>“<i>kwiarra arra</i>” (three).</li>
<li>“<i>kwiarra kwiarra</i>” (four).</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond four, counting either goes by “hands” or “feet,” or
for ordinary purposes there are two comprehensive words in
use which signify a “small-large number” and a “large-small
number.” In some cases, such as the Aluridja, “one” (“<i>goitarada</i>”)
appears as the diminutive form of “two” (“<i>goitara</i>”).
In the same sense, a shorter distance is expressed by the Wongapitcha
as the diminutive of a great distance by qualifying the
word “<i>wurnma</i>,” meaning “far,” by affixing “<i>wimuggitta</i>,”
which means “young.” Hence “<i>wimuggitta wurnma</i>” reads
the “young (one) of far,” i.e. “close up.” This is really the
same way of expressing a fraction of space as the same tribe
has adopted for expressing minority in age; a youth or young
man is known as “<i>wimuggitta wardi</i>,” the second word “<i>wardi</i>”
standing for an adult man.</p>

</figure>

<p>The Dieri of the Lake Eyre region have one of the most
elaborate systems of numeration, which includes, at any rate,
an expression for every number up to eleven.</p>

<ul>
<li>“<i>kulno</i>,” one.</li>
<li>“<i>mandru</i>,” two.</li>
<li>“<i>parkulu</i>” or “<i>parkulintja</i>,” three.</li>
<li>“<i>mandru mandru</i>,” four.<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span></p></li>
<li>“<i>mandru ja parkulintja</i>,” five.</li>
<li>or “<i>marra warra kulno</i>,” five, i.e. hand part one (one hand).</li>
<li>“<i>marra pirri kulno</i>,” six.</li>
<li>“<i>marra pirri mandru</i>,” seven.</li>
<li>“<i>marra pirri parkulintja</i>,” eight.</li>
<li>“<i>marra pirri mandru mandru</i>,” nine.</li>
<li>“<i>marra warra mandru</i>” ten, i.e. hand parts two (two hands).</li>
<li>“<i>tjinna pirri kulno</i>,” eleven.</li>
<li>“<i>marrapu</i>,” many.</li>
<li>“<i>mörla marrapu</i>,” very many.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the above table the following explanations will be found
useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>“<i>ja</i>” = and.</li>
<li>“<i>marra</i>” = hand.</li>
<li>“<i>tjinna</i>” = foot.</li>
<li>“<i>warra</i>” = part.</li>
<li>“<i>pirri</i>” = nail (toe or finger).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus the reading of the numerals runs: One, two, three,
two-two (four), two and three (five), or one hand part (five),
hand finger-nails one (six), hand finger-nails two (seven),
hand finger-nails three (eight), hand finger-nails four (nine),
two hand parts (ten), foot toe-nails one (eleven).</p>

<p>To imply a repetition or continuance of action, the frequent
use of the same verb is avoided by the Sunday Islanders, but
the same effect is achieved by reiterating the word “<i>garra</i>” indefinitely.
The expression of continued action is usually in
the present tense and is mostly applied to words like “running,”
“walking,” “jumping,” “sleeping,” “raining,” “blowing,”
“bleeding,” etc., etc. For example, a man from a tree or
other look-out might be describing to his companions below,
the doings of their hunting party out on the plain; while the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
latter keep moving, he conveys the fact to his hearers by ejaculating
“<i>garra, garra, garra</i>, ...” The direction of the
hunters’ movements is indicated by the swing of his hand. The
moment the observer in the tree stops saying “<i>garra</i>,” the people
below know that the hunters have ducked or have temporarily
ceased the pursuit.</p>

<p>The terminal syllable of a word is never uttered very clearly
by an aboriginal; and it is consequently difficult to distinguish
between a short e, a, o, or u. This is particularly true of the
language used by the old men, the defectiveness being often
increased by the gaps between the incisors resulting from the
initiation ceremonies.</p>

<p>There are occasions, however, when the last syllable receives
especial emphasis. The Wongapitcha word for plenty is
“<i>ura</i>”; when the idea of plenty is great the word becomes
“<i>ura-ku</i>,” with an intentional intonation upon the “<i>ku</i>”; and
when the plenty is extraordinary, the word receives yet another
syllable and becomes the superlative “<i>ura-ku-pu</i>.”</p>

<p>The simple affirmative of the Aluridja, which has also been
adopted by the Arunndta, is “<i>o</i>,” less commonly “<i>u</i>”; but when
strong affirmation is intended the word is changed to “<i>owa</i>,”
or “<i>owau</i>.”</p>

<p>The ordinary negative of the Arunndta is “<i>itja</i>”; but forcibly
expressed this may become “<i>itjama</i>” or “<i>itjingalai</i>.”</p>

<p>Any sudden exclamation or accidental noise, like a cough
or sneeze, might be exaggerated by the addition of a syllable
at the end. When a Sunday Islander sneezes he makes a word
out of the natural noise sounding like “<i>Tish-e!</i>”</p>

<p>An exclamation which is common practically to all Australian
tribes, and may express surprise, fear, pain, or disgust,
is a very liquid “<i>irr</i>.” The Arunndta have strengthened this
monosyllabic cry by giving it the suffix “<i>ai</i>”; nowadays the
word is, however, mostly pronounced “<i>Yerrai!</i>” A variety of
the last-named, but not quite so forceful, is “<i>Yakai!</i>” A sudden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
fright or the anticipation of harm might produce a very short
“<i>i</i>,” without any indication of the presence of the liquid consonant.</p>

<p>Appreciation is indicated by “<i>Aha!</i>” or “<i>Hm-hm!</i>” practically
throughout the central and northern districts of Australia; in
both cases special emphasis is applied to the second syllable.</p>

<p>A central Australian exclamation calling one to order or
attention in a somewhat harsh manner is “<i>Wai!</i>” When one
person is being irritated by another, such as a parent by a
whining child, the offender is thus rebuked. This word may
also become a suffix; it may be combined, for instance, with the
radical “<i>irr</i>” and produce a word “<i>Yirrawai</i>,” which is perhaps
the strongest in a sense of disgust and reproach available in the
Arunndta tongue.</p>

<p>Standing at the end of an adjective, the expression “<i>’n-dora</i>”
in the same dialect signifies a great or superlative degree; e.g.
“<i>marra</i>” means “nice,” but “<i>marr’n-dora</i>” a conception more
like “excellent.” In the opposite sense, “<i>kurrina</i>” (bad) becomes
“<i>kurrina’n-dora</i>” (worst). The same suffix can be attached
to an adverb. When, say, an emphatic denial is needed,
“<i>itja</i>” (no) takes the form of “<i>itja’n-dora</i>.”</p>

<p>There are numerous other syllables, which, when fixed to
the end of a word, convey a special significance. When, in the
Arunndta, the syllable “<i>tu</i>” is added to a person’s name in address,
it really stands in place of a sentence like “Is it not so?”
For instance, “<i>Nani knulia atoa utnuriraka, Endola-tu?</i>” when
literally translated reads: “This dog man bit Endola, is it
not so?” Endola is the name of a woman who is being addressed.
In place of “<i>tu</i>,” the longer form of “<i>ditjekwi</i>” might
be used.</p>

<p>Again, the suffix “<i>lo</i>” is found in daily use in the same dialect;
it stands for the phrase: “Where is?” Hence the completed
sentence, “<i>Kwatche-lo?</i>” stands for “Where is the
water?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span></p>

<p>When one finds “<i>jara</i>” added to a word, plurality is indicated,
the sense conveyed being that many of the kind specified
by the noun are assumed. The word for girl in the Arunndta
is “<i>kware</i>,” consequently “<i>kwarenjara</i>” means that a number of
girls are being considered, the “<i>n</i>” being simply interposed for
the sake of euphony.</p>

<p>Any proper noun, like the name of a person, may be modified
by adding “<i>ia</i>” to it, and, by so doing, one makes it a term of
endearment in the vocative case. “<i>Ware</i>” ordinarily means
“boy,” but by altering it to “<i>waria</i>” (i.e. “<i>ware-ia</i>”), the
meaning becomes “dear boy” or “O boy.”</p>

<p>If the terminal “<i>a</i>” of a substantive is found to be changed
to “<i>inna</i>,” the diminutive of the original is implied. A somewhat
common name for a woman in the Arunndta is “<i>Unnruba</i>,”
but during the years of childhood of a bearer of this
name, the appellation is always in the form of “<i>Unnrubinna</i>”;
in later years this changes to “<i>Unnruba</i>” more or less automatically.</p>

<p>A diminutive sense is also conveyed by duplicating an original
word. In the eastern Aluridja dialect “<i>kaitji</i>” means an ordinary
spear, whereas “<i>kaitji-kaitji</i>” is an expression applied to a
toy spear. The Dieri recognize a Supreme Being whom they
call “<i>Mura</i>”; any one of their numerous demi-gods, however,
from whom they trace their descent is referred to as a “<i>Mura-Mura</i>.”</p>

<p>Alterations in the ending of a verb indicate different moods
and tenses. The verb “to come” in the Arunndta is “<i>pitchima</i>”;
its inflections and their meanings will become apparent from the
following short sentences:</p>

<ul>
<li>“<i>Pitchai arrekutcha!</i>” Come here, old woman!</li>
<li>“<i>Pitchikarrerai arrekutch’njara!</i>” Come here, old women!</li>
<li>“<i>Arrekutcha pitchama.</i>” The old woman is coming.<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span></p></li>
<li>“<i>Arrekutcha pitchika.</i>” The old woman came (or has come).</li>
<li>“<i>Arrekutcha pitchichinna.</i>” The old woman will come.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we replace the verb “<i>pitchima</i>” by “<i>lama</i>” (“to go”), the
inflections, taken in the same order as above, become: “<i>lai</i>,”
“<i>larrirai</i>,” “<i>lakama</i>,” “<i>laka</i>,” “<i>litchinna</i>.”</p>

<p>An adverb which finds considerable application in the
Arunndta is “<i>kalla</i>,” indicating the completion of any deed or
action. Most frequently the nearest translation would be supplied
by the English word, “already.” If, therefore, we again
consider one of the above sentences and interpose the word
“<i>kalla</i>,” the meaning is strengthened considerably: “<i>Arrekutcha
kalla pitchama</i>” then means “The old woman is already
coming.” But “<i>kalla</i>” might further convey the sense of repletion.
“<i>Einga knullia kalla kwatche n’ dai</i>” would mean,
literally translated, “I dog enough water gave.” And finally
“<i>kalla</i>” might express the completion of an action. A native,
after losing the track of an animal, or having eaten as much
as he wants, might be heard to say “<i>kalla</i>,” meaning “finished.”
Finally “<i>kalla</i>” might even stand for “dead.” We have already
noted a similar word in the vocabulary of the Sunday Islanders,
viz. “<i>Kaleya</i>,” meaning “finish” or “good-bye.”</p>

<p>The personal pronouns are either used as separate words in
a sentence, or they appear as prefixes to the principal verbs.</p>

<p>In the Arunndta, the following are used:</p>

<ul>
<li>“<i>einga</i>,” I; “<i>nuka</i>,” mine; “<i>eingana</i>,” me.</li>
<li>“<i>unda</i>,” thou; “<i>unguranga</i>,” thine; “<i>ngana</i>,” thee.</li>
<li>“<i>era</i>,” he; “<i>ekurra</i>,” his; “<i>erinna</i>,” him.</li>
<li>“<i>nuna</i>,” we; “<i>nunaka</i>,” ours; “<i>nungana</i>,” us.</li>
<li>“<i>rankara</i>,” you; “<i>rakankara</i>,” yours; “<i>rankarana</i>,” you.</li>
<li>“<i>etna</i>,” they; “<i>etnaka</i>,” theirs; “<i>etnana</i>,” them.</li>
</ul>

<p>As an illustration let us translate: “I like the boy”; we
should have to transpose the words into the following order,
“I boy like,” and the Arunndta would be: “<i>Einga ware unjinum</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
On the other hand, we might select the Sunday
Island dialect as an example in which prefixes are used for representing
the personal pronouns. The first personal prefix is
“<i>nun</i>,” the second “<i>min</i>,” and the third “<i>il</i>” or “<i>n’</i>.” If, therefore,
we take a simple verb like “<i>jakuli</i>” to “break,” we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>“<i>nunjaluki</i>,” I break.</li>
<li>“<i>minjaluki</i>,” you break.</li>
<li>“<i>iljaluki</i>” or “<i>n’jaluki</i>,” he breaks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third person plural is represented by “<i>punjanga n’</i>”;
hence “<i>punjanga n’jaluki</i>” stands for “they (altogether) break.”</p>

<p>Whereas we have seen that an “<i>n</i>” might be interposed between
two words for the sake of euphony, it no less frequently
happens that two or more words are contracted into one for
similar reasons. If, to quote a simple case, we wish to translate
into Arunndta “You give (it) me,” we have three separate
words, “<i>unda</i>” (you), “<i>nuka</i>” (me), and “<i>dai</i>” (give), which
in the above expression are fused into one word, “<i>nukundai</i>.”</p>

<p>Apart from the full and pure vowel sounds, the Australian
aboriginal dialects include the modified sounds expressed by the
German diphthongs, œ, äu, and ue (i.e. the French u). The
pairs of consonants, p and b, k and g, and t and d, are often
interchanged during speech. Sibilant sounds are extremely rare.
My own name was very difficult, if not impossible, for the
Aluridja to pronounce; the best they could make of it was
“<i>Battedu</i>.” So, also, the imported pet name of the domestic
cat, “pussy-pussy,” as it is used by the settlers, cannot be
managed. The Aluridja call it “<i>putte-putte</i>,” and the
Arunndta “<i>put-pudtha</i>.”</p>

<p>Let us look into the construction of the Aluridja personal
pronouns a little more carefully. Every pronoun consists of a
stem, which is different for every person, and an ending, which
varies with the case.</p>

<p>The stems are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span></p>

<ul>
<li>First person, singular, “<i>naiu</i>”; plural, “<i>nganan</i>.”</li>
<li>Second person, singular, “<i>nuntu</i>”; plural, “<i>nurangari</i>.”</li>
<li>Third person, singular, “<i>balu</i>”; plural, “<i>tana</i>.”</li>
</ul>

<p>And the endings are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Genitive, “-<i>ba</i>.”</li>
<li>Dative, “-<i>lukuru</i>.”</li>
<li>Accusative, “-<i>na</i>.”</li>
<li>Ablative, “-<i>languru</i>” (from), or “-<i>lawana</i>” (with).</li>
</ul>

<p>A simple sentence embodying three pronouns would be:
“<i>Naiulu tanalawana nuntulukura ngalierra</i>,” which, literally
translated, reads: “I with them to you have come.”</p>

<p>A few of the Arunndta interrogatives are:</p>

<ul>
<li>“<i>Ewunna?</i>” What? or What is it?</li>
<li>“<i>Unndana?</i>” Where?</li>
<li>“<i>Nguna?</i>” Which?</li>
<li>“<i>Ngula?</i>” Who?</li>
<li>“<i>Ntakinya?</i>” How many?</li>
</ul>

<p>The aspirate is very occasionally met with. The local group
of the Arunndta, residing at Arltunga, which styles itself
“<i>Herrinda</i>,” is one of the few exceptions. Even in the settled
districts, where the natives have adopted European names, one
christened “Harry” is usually spoken of as “<i>Yarri</i>.” The
sounds which are most commonly aspirated are the exclamations,
e.g. “<i>Hai!</i>” “<i>Aha</i>,” and “<i>Hm-hm!</i>”</p>

<p>Used in conjunction with a vowel, usually an “a,” the consonantal
combination “<i>ng</i>” is common to all Australian dialects.
Although to the modern tongue a little difficult to master, the
sound is strikingly fluent with the aboriginal; indeed, its frequent
inclusion in words of fundamentally simple origin suggests
a primitive, natural derivation. Along the north-western
coast, the words for “water” are “<i>ngawa</i>” (Wave Hill),
“<i>ngauwa</i>” (Humbert River), “<i>kornga</i>” (Sunday Island).</p>

<p>In the Arunndta, “<i>nga</i>” stands for either “Here you are!”
“There!” or “Take it!” all phrases being used in the sense of
offering something to a person, such as mother to infant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
“<i>Ngaboni</i>” is a modified form of the last-named, having any of
the following meanings: “Here!” “Look!” or “Behold!” And
“<i>ngarai</i>” is yet another modification of similar significance,
usually placed immediately behind the object it is desired to
draw attention to, e.g. “<i>Arre ngarai!</i>” (Look at the kangaroo).</p>

<p>Verbal greetings, akin to our “Good-day!” are rarely, if
ever, made use of by natives when they meet; but some of the
tribes recognize an orthodox term of salutation at partings, as
indicating a friendly feeling which the speaker bears towards
the person he is on the point of leaving. The Mulluk-Mulluk
and some of their neighbours on the Daly River have adopted
the word “<i>mummuk</i>” to express their farewell, whilst the Sunday
Islanders’ vocabulary includes a similar expression in the
word “<i>tchorrogu</i>.”</p>

<p>An alarm, such as we would raise in the form of “Look out!”
or “Get out of the way!” is rendered by the Arunndta “<i>Par-le!</i>”</p>

<p>There are numerous examples which could be mentioned of
words appearing in an aboriginal dialect which have a striking
resemblance to European words of modern and ancient languages,
which at this stage of our knowledge of primitive
tongues must be recorded as curiosities rather than linguistic
analogies. One of the most remarkable, perhaps, is the
Arunndta for head, viz. “<i>kaputa</i>”; but to connect this in any
way with the Latin word would be as unreasonable as calling
the “patriarchal” type of aboriginal a semite.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not my intention to suggest anything beyond
mere coincidence, and it lies far from my mind to attempt
theorizing upon little evidence, yet it must be admitted that
similarities in points of evolution and culture, no matter how
trivial and accidental they may be, are not without interest.
Viewed entirely in this light, there is no harm in mentioning
one or two similarities which exist between certain words of
the Australian dialects and those of other tongues, articulate or
otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span></p>

<p>Affirmation is expressed in the Cambridge Gulf district by
“<i>yau</i>,” “<i>yo-au</i>,” or “<i>yowai</i>.” During latter years, the same expression
has found its way south, even as far as the MacDonnell
Ranges, where it has largely replaced the original form of
“<i>owa</i>.” In the adjoining coastal districts of the Northern Territory,
a similar word is in use as well as one which sounds
more like the German “<i>ja</i>.” It is of more than passing interest
to note that throughout the Malay Archipelago “<i>yo-au</i>” or
“<i>yowai</i>” is the principal form of affirmation in use among the
local primitive peoples. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the
early Macassan trepang fishers, who used to visit the north
coast of Australia long before the white man arrived, brought
this word along with them.</p>

<p>We find, also, that the consonantal expression, “<i>ng</i>,” combined
with a vowel sound, is common among other primitive
languages. Professor Garner, too, has found it included in the
inarticulate “speech” of apes in the form of a note indicating
satisfaction, which can be represented by “<i>ngkw-a</i>.” The
speculative mind naturally wonders whether this simian cry of
satisfaction is perhaps fundamentally of similar, though independent,
phonetic origin to the northern Australian word for
water, the essential of life, which we noted above is “<i>ngawa</i>.”</p>

<p>The di-syllabic muttering of a European child-in-arms, moreover,
which the happy parents flatter themselves sounds like
“pa-pa” or “ma-ma,” is equally characteristic of the aboriginal
babe, but the parents in the latter case interpret the note to be
“<i>nga-nga</i>.” And, indeed, the Arunndta mother responds by
handing the infant the fluid it needs, while she caressingly
soothes it with the simple little word “<i>Nga</i>,” which in our own
language would be equivalent to the sentence, “Here you are!”</p>
